# Use the specified file as a custom template for the generated document.
# Implies --standalone. See Templates, below, for a description of template syntax.
# If no extension is specified, an extension corresponding to the writer will be added,
# so that --template=special looks for special.html for HTML output.

html-math-method:
  method: mathml
# Convert TeX math to MathML (in epub3, docbook4, docbook5, jats, html4 and html5).
# MathML is supported natively by the main web browsers and select e-book readers.

section-divs: true
# Wrap sections in <section> tags, and attach identifiers to the enclosing <section> rather than the heading itself.

split-level: 2
# Specify the heading level at which to split an EPUB or chunked HTML document into separate files.

chunk-template: "%s-%i.html"
# Specify a template for the filenames in a chunkedhtml document.
# In the template, %n will be replaced by the chunk number (padded with leading 0s to 3 digits),
# %s with the section number of the chunk, %h with the heading text (with formatting removed),
# %i with the section identifier. For example, %section-%s-%i.html might be resolved to
# section-1.1-introduction.html. The characters / and \ are not allowed in chunk templates and will be ignored.
# The default is %s-%i.html.

include-in-header:
  - pandoc/includes/opendsa-header.html
  - pandoc/includes/quiz-header.html
# Include contents of FILE, verbatim, at the end of the header.
# This can be used, for example, to include special CSS or JavaScript in HTML documents.

# include-before-body:
#   - inc.tex
# Include contents of FILE, verbatim, at the beginning of the document body
# (e.g. after the <body> tag in HTML, or the \begin{document} command in LaTeX).
# This can be used to include navigation bars or banners in HTML documents.

# include-after-body:
#   - inc.tex
# Include contents of FILE, verbatim, at the end of the document body
# (before the </body> tag in HTML, or the \end{document} command in LaTeX).

# html-q-tags: true
# Use <q> tags for quotes in HTML.

# wrap: auto|none|preserve
# Determine how text is wrapped in the output (the source code, not the rendered version).
# With auto (the default), pandoc will attempt to wrap lines to the column width specified
# by --columns (default 72). With none, pandoc will not wrap lines at all. With preserve,
# pandoc will attempt to preserve the wrapping from the source document (that is, where there
# are nonsemantic newlines in the source, there will be nonsemantic newlines in the output as well).
# In ipynb output, this option affects wrapping of the contents of Markdown cells.

# columns: NUMBER
# Specify length of lines in characters. This affects text wrapping in the generated source code

# strip-comments: true
# Strip out HTML comments in the Markdown or Textile source, rather than passing them on
