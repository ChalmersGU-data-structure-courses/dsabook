title-prefix: DSABook
# Specify STRING as a prefix at the beginning of the title that appears in the HTML header

reader: markdown
# pandoc --from=markdown --list-extensions

number-sections: true
# Number section headings in LaTeX, ConTeXt, HTML, Docx, ms, or EPUB output.
# By default, sections are not numbered. Sections with class unnumbered will never be numbered,
# even if --number-sections is specified.

top-level-division: chapter
# Treat top-level headings as the given division type in LaTeX, ConTeXt, DocBook, and TEI output.
# The hierarchy order is part, chapter, then section; all headings are shifted such that
# the top-level heading becomes the specified type.

syntax-definitions: [pandoc/syntax-highlight/pseudo.xml]
# Instructs pandoc to load a KDE XML syntax definition file, which will be used for syntax highlighting
# of appropriately marked code blocks. This can be used to add support for new languages or to use altered
# syntax definitions for existing languages. This option may be repeated to add multiple syntax definitions.

indented-code-classes: [pseudo]
# Specify classes to use for indented code blocks–for example, perl,numberLines or haskell.
# Multiple classes may be separated by spaces or commas.

reference-location: block
# reference-location: block|section|document
# Specify whether footnotes (and references, if reference-links is set) are placed at
# the end of the current (top-level) block, the current section, or the document. The default is document.

writer: chunkedhtml
# pandoc --to=chunkedhtml --list-extensions

template: dsabook.html
# Use the specified file as a custom template for the generated document.
# Implies --standalone. See Templates, below, for a description of template syntax.
# If no extension is specified, an extension corresponding to the writer will be added,
# so that --template=special looks for special.html for HTML output.

css:
  - ../css/main.css
  - ../css/book.css
  - ../css/code.css
  - ../css/math.css
  - ../css/quiz.css
  - ../css/mobile.css
  - ../css/print.css
# Link to a CSS style sheet. This option can be used repeatedly to include multiple files.

table-of-contents: true
toc-depth: 3

# highlight-style: tango
# pandoc --list-highlight-styles
# pygments, tango, espresso, zenburn, kate, monochrome, breezedark, haddock


html-math-method:
  method: mathml
  # method: MathJax
  # method: katex
# Convert TeX math to MathML, MathJax, or KaTeX.

section-divs: true
# Wrap sections in <section> tags, and attach identifiers to the enclosing <section> rather than the heading itself.

split-level: 2
# Specify the heading level at which to split an EPUB or chunked HTML document into separate files.

chunk-template: "section-%s.html"
# Specify a template for the filenames in a chunkedhtml document.
# In the template, %n will be replaced by the chunk number (padded with leading 0s to 3 digits),
# %s with the section number of the chunk, %h with the heading text (with formatting removed),
# %i with the section identifier. For example, %section-%s-%i.html might be resolved to
# section-1.1-introduction.html. The characters / and \ are not allowed in chunk templates and will be ignored.
# The default is %s-%i.html.

include-in-header:
  - pandoc/includes/opendsa-header.html
  - pandoc/includes/quiz-header.html
# Include contents of FILE, verbatim, at the end of the header.
# This can be used, for example, to include special CSS or JavaScript in HTML documents.

# include-before-body:
#   - inc.tex
# Include contents of FILE, verbatim, at the beginning of the document body
# (e.g. after the <body> tag in HTML, or the \begin{document} command in LaTeX).
# This can be used to include navigation bars or banners in HTML documents.

# include-after-body:
#   - inc.tex
# Include contents of FILE, verbatim, at the end of the document body
# (before the </body> tag in HTML, or the \end{document} command in LaTeX).

# html-q-tags: true
# Use <q> tags for quotes in HTML.

# wrap: auto|none|preserve
# Determine how text is wrapped in the output (the source code, not the rendered version).
# With auto (the default), pandoc will attempt to wrap lines to the column width specified
# by --columns (default 72). With none, pandoc will not wrap lines at all. With preserve,
# pandoc will attempt to preserve the wrapping from the source document (that is, where there
# are nonsemantic newlines in the source, there will be nonsemantic newlines in the output as well).
# In ipynb output, this option affects wrapping of the contents of Markdown cells.

# columns: NUMBER
# Specify length of lines in characters. This affects text wrapping in the generated source code

strip-comments: true
# Strip out HTML comments in the Markdown or Textile source, rather than passing them on
