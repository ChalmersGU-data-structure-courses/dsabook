variables:
  lang: en-GB

title-prefix: DSABook
# Specify STRING as a prefix at the beginning of the title that appears in the HTML header

reader: markdown
# pandoc --from=markdown --list-extensions

number-sections: true
# Number section headings in LaTeX, ConTeXt, HTML, Docx, ms, or EPUB output.
# By default, sections are not numbered. Sections with class unnumbered will never be numbered,
# even if --number-sections is specified.

top-level-division: chapter
# Treat top-level headings as the given division type in LaTeX, ConTeXt, DocBook, and TEI output.
# The hierarchy order is part, chapter, then section; all headings are shifted such that
# the top-level heading becomes the specified type.

syntax-definitions: [pandoc/syntax-highlight/pseudo.xml]
# Instructs pandoc to load a KDE XML syntax definition file, which will be used for syntax highlighting
# of appropriately marked code blocks. This can be used to add support for new languages or to use altered
# syntax definitions for existing languages. This option may be repeated to add multiple syntax definitions.

indented-code-classes: [pseudo]
# Specify classes to use for indented code blocks–for example, perl,numberLines or haskell.
# Multiple classes may be separated by spaces or commas.

reference-location: block
# reference-location: block|section|document
# Specify whether footnotes (and references, if reference-links is set) are placed at
# the end of the current (top-level) block, the current section, or the document. The default is document.
