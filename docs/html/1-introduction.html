Introduction</h1>
<p>How many cities with more than 250,000 people lie within 500 miles of
Dallas, Texas? How many people in my company make over $100,000 per
year? Can we connect all of our telephone customers with less than 1,000
miles of cable? To answer questions like these, it is not enough to have
the necessary information. We must organize that information in a way
that allows us to find the answers in time to satisfy our needs.</p>
<p>Representing information is fundamental to computer science. The
primary purpose of most computer programs is not to perform
calculations, but to store and retrieve information – usually as fast as
possible. For this reason, the study of data structures and the
algorithms that manipulate them is at the heart of computer science. And
that is what this book is about – helping you to understand how to
structure information to support efficient processing.</p>
<p>Any course on Data Structures and Algorithms will try to teach you
about three things:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>It will present a collection of commonly used data structures and
algorithms. These form a programmer’s basic “toolkit”. For many
problems, some data structure or algorithm in the toolkit will provide a
good solution. We focus on data structures and algorithms that have
proven over time to be most useful.</li>
<li>It will introduce the idea of tradeoffs, and reinforce the concept
that there are costs and benefits associated with every data structure
or algorithm. This is done by describing, for each data structure, the
amount of space and time required for typical operations. For each
algorithm, we examine the time required for key input types.</li>
<li>It will teach you how to measure the effectiveness of a data
structure or algorithm. Only through such measurement can you determine
which data structure in your toolkit is most appropriate for a new
problem. The techniques presented also allow you to judge the merits of
new data structures that you or others might invent.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are often many approaches to solving a problem. How do we
choose between them? At the heart of computer program design are two
(sometimes conflicting) goals:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>To design an algorithm that is easy to understand, code, and
debug.</li>
<li>To design an algorithm that makes efficient use of the computer’s
resources.</li>
</ol>
<p>Ideally, the resulting program is true to both of these goals. We
might say that such a program is “elegant.” While the algorithms and
program code examples presented here attempt to be elegant in this
sense, it is not the purpose of this book to explicitly treat issues
related to goal (1). These are primarily concerns for the discipline of
Software Engineering. Rather, we mostly focus on issues relating to goal
(2).</p>
<p>How do we measure efficiency? Our method for evaluating the
efficiency of an algorithm or computer program is called <a
href="10-glossary.html#asymptotic-analysis" class="term"
title="A method for estimating the efficiency of an algorithm or computer program by identifying its asymptotic complexity, the growth rate of its complexity function. Asymptotic analysis also gives a way to define the inherent difficulty of a problem. We frequently use the term algorithm analysis to mean the same thing.">asymptotic
analysis</a>. Asymptotic analysis also gives a way to define the
inherent difficulty of a problem. Throughout the book we use asymptotic
analysis techniques to estimate the time cost for every algorithm
presented. This allows you to see how each algorithm compares to other
algorithms for solving the same problem in terms of its efficiency.</p>
<section id="a-philosophy-of-data-structures" class="level3 unnumbered">
<h3 class="unnumbered">A Philosophy of Data Structures</h3>
<p>You might think that with ever more powerful computers, program
efficiency is becoming less important. After all, processor speed and
memory size still continue to improve. Won’t today’s efficiency problem
be solved by tomorrow’s hardware?</p>
<p>As we develop more powerful computers, our history so far has always
been to use that additional computing power to tackle more complex
problems, be it in the form of more sophisticated user interfaces,
bigger problem sizes, or new problems previously deemed computationally
infeasible. More complex problems demand more computation, making the
need for efficient programs even greater. Unfortunately, as tasks become
more complex, they become less like our everyday experience. So today’s
computer scientists must be trained to have a thorough understanding of
the principles behind efficient program design, because their ordinary
life experiences often do not apply when designing computer
programs.</p>
<p>In the most general sense, a <a
href="10-glossary.html#data-structure" class="term"
title="The implementation for an ADT.">data structure</a> is any data
representation and its associated operations. Even an integer or
floating point number stored on the computer can be viewed as a simple
data structure. More commonly, people use the term “data structure” to
mean an organization or structuring for a collection of data items. A
sorted list of integers stored in an array is an example of such a
structuring. These ideas are explored further in a discussion of <a
href="1.2-abstract-data-types.html#abstract-data-types">Abstract Data
Types</a>.</p>
<p>Given sufficient space to store a collection of <a
href="10-glossary.html#data-item" class="term"
title="A piece of information or a record whose value is drawn from a type.">data
item</a>s, it is always possible to search for specified items within
the collection, print or otherwise process the data items in any desired
order, or modify the value of any particular data item. The most obvious
example is an unsorted array containing all of the data items. It is
possible to perform all necessary operations on an unsorted array.
However, using the proper data structure can make the difference between
a program running in a few seconds and one requiring many days. For
example, searching for a given record in a <a
href="10-glossary.html#hash-table" class="term"
title="The data structure (usually an array) that stores data records for lookup using hashing.">hash
table</a> is much faster than searching for it in an unsorted array.</p>
<p>A solution is said to be <a href="10-glossary.html#efficient"
class="term"
title="A solution is said to be efficient if it solves the problem within the required resource constraints. A solution is sometimes said to be efficient if it requires fewer resources than known alternatives, regardless of whether it meets any particular requirements.">efficient</a>
if it solves the problem within the required <a
href="10-glossary.html#resource-constraints" class="term"
title="Examples of resource constraints include the total space available to store the data (possibly divided into separate main memory and disk space constraints) and the time allowed to perform each subtask.">resource
constraints</a>. Examples of resource constraints include the total
space available to store the data – possibly divided into separate main
memory and disk space constraints – and the time allowed to perform each
subtask. A solution is sometimes said to be efficient if it requires
fewer resources than known alternatives, regardless of whether it meets
any particular requirements. The <a href="10-glossary.html#cost"
class="term"
title="The amount of resources that given run of an algorithm consumes.">cost</a>
of a solution is the amount of resources that the solution consumes.
Most often, cost is measured in terms of one key resource such as time,
with the implied assumption that the solution meets the other resource
constraints.</p>
