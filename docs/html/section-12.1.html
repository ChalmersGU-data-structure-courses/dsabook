Hash functions</h2>
<p>Hashing generally takes records whose key values come from a large
range and stores those records in a table with a relatively small number
of slots. Collisions occur when two records hash to the same slot in the
table. If we are careful – or lucky – when selecting a hash function,
then the actual number of collisions will be few. Unfortunately, even
under the best of circumstances, collisions are nearly unavoidable. To
illustrate, consider a classroom full of students. What is the
probability that some pair of students shares the same birthday (i.e.,
the same day of the year, not necessarily the same year)? If there are
23 students, then the odds are about even that two will share a
birthday. This is despite the fact that there are 365 days in which
students can have birthdays (ignoring leap years). On most days, no
student in the class has a birthday. With more students, the probability
of a shared birthday increases. The mapping of students to days based on
their birthday is similar to assigning records to slots in a table (of
size 365) using the birthday as a hash function. Note that this
observation tells us nothing about <em>which</em> students share a
birthday, or on <em>which</em> days of the year shared birthdays
fall.</p>

<p>Try it for yourself. You can use the calculator to see the
probability of a collision. The default values are set to show the
number of people in a room such that the chance of a duplicate is just
over 50%. But you can set any table size and any number of records to
determine the probability of a collision under those conditions.</p>

<p>To be practical, a database organised by hashing must store records
in a hash table that is not so large that it wastes space. To balance
time and space efficiency, this means that the hash table should be
around half full (see <a
href="section-12.9.html#sec:analysis-of-hash-tables">Section 12.9</a>).
Because collisions are extremely likely to occur under these conditions
(by chance, any record inserted into a table that is half full should
have a collision half of the time), does this mean that we need not
worry about how well a hash function does at avoiding collisions?
Absolutely not. The difference between using a good hash function and a
bad hash function makes a big difference in practice in the number of
records that must be examined when searching or inserting to the table.
Technically, any function that maps all possible key values to a slot in
the hash table is a hash function. In the extreme case, even a function
that maps all records to the same slot in the array is a hash function,
but it does nothing to help us find records during a search
operation.</p>
<p>We would like to pick a hash function that maps keys to slots in a
way that makes each slot in the hash table have equal probablility of
being filled for the actual set keys being used. Unfortunately, we
normally have no control over the distribution of key values for the
actual records in a given database or collection. So how well any
particular hash function does depends on the actual distribution of the
keys used within the allowable key range. In some cases, incoming data
are well distributed across their key range. For example, if the input
is a set of random numbers selected uniformly from the key range, any
hash function that assigns the key range so that each slot in the hash
table receives an equal share of the range will likely also distribute
the input records uniformly within the table. However, in many
applications the incoming records are highly clustered or otherwise
poorly distributed. When input records are not well distributed
throughout the key range it can be difficult to devise a hash function
that does a good job of distributing the records throughout the table,
especially if the input distribution is not known in advance. There are
many reasons why data values might be poorly distributed:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Natural frequency distributions tend to follow a common pattern
where a few of the entities occur frequently while most entities occur
relatively rarely. For example, consider the populations of the 100
largest cities. If you plot these populations on a numberline, most of
them will be clustered toward the low side, with a few outliers on the
high side. Viewed the other way, the home town for a given person is far
more likely to be a particular large city than a particular small
town.</li>
<li>Collected data are likely to be skewed in some way. Field samples
might be rounded to, say, the nearest 5 (i.e., all numbers end in 5 or
0).</li>
<li>If the input is a collection of common English words, the beginning
letter will be poorly distributed.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that for items 2 and 3 on the list above, either high- or
low-order bits of the key are poorly distributed. When designing hash
functions, we are generally faced with one of two situations:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>We know nothing about the distribution of the incoming keys. In this
case, we wish to select a hash function that evenly distributes the key
range across the hash table, while avoiding obvious opportunities for
clustering such as hash functions that are sensitive to the high- or
low-order bits of the key value.</li>
<li>We know something about the distribution of the incoming keys. In
this case, we should use a distribution-dependent hash function that
avoids assigning clusters of related key values to the same hash table
slot. For example, if hashing English words, we should <em>not</em> hash
on the value of the first character because this is likely to be
unevenly distributed.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the rest of this section, and in <a
href="section-12.10.html#sec:better-hash-functions">Section 12.10</a>,
you will see several examples of hash functions that illustrate these
points.</p>

<h3 data-number="12.1.1"><span

<p>Any hash function
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>𝐡</mi><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbf{h}</annotation></semantics></math>
must respect the following properties:</p>

regardless of when it is called</li>
<li>it must <em>preserve equality</em>: if

is equal to
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>b</mi><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">b</annotation></semantics></math>,
then

</ul>
<p>Furthermore, a <em>good</em> hash function should also respect the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>uniform distribution</em>:
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>𝐡</mi><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbf{h}</annotation></semantics></math>
should map the expected inputs as evenly as possible over the possible
output values</li>
<li><em>efficiency</em>: the hash function should be fast to
calculate</li>
</ul>
<section id="sec:example-the-worst-hash-function"
class="level4 unnumbered example">
<h4 class="unnumbered">Example: The worst hash function</h4>
<p>The requirements above tells us that the following is a valid hash
function, because is both deterministic and preserves equality:</p>
<p><math display="block" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>𝐡</mi><mo stretchy="false" form="prefix">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo stretchy="false" form="postfix">)</mo><mo>=</mo><mn>42</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">
\mathbf{h}(x) = 42
</annotation></semantics></math></p>
<p>However, it’s a really bad hash function, because it gives the worst
possible distribution.</p>
</section>
<p>This means that if you implement a hash table which uses this
constant hash function, it will still work. It will answer all your
questions correctly, and insertion and deletion will work just as
expected. But it will be extremely slow – as slow as if you had used a
simple list of values.</p>

data-number="12.1.2">
<h3 data-number="12.1.2"><span
class="header-section-number">12.1.2</span> Basic principles of hash
functions</h3>
<p>Here are some basic principles for creating good (or at least
mostly-good-enough) hash functions.</p>
<section id="sec:integers-characters-and-enumerations"
class="level4 unnumbered">
<h4 class="unnumbered">Integers, characters and enumerations</h4>
<p>Since the value of a hash function should be an integer, it is very
easy to just let value be its own hash code, if it’s an integer.</p>
<p><math display="block" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>𝐡</mi><mo stretchy="false" form="prefix">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo stretchy="false" form="postfix">)</mo><mo>=</mo><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">
\mathbf{h}(x) = x
</annotation></semantics></math></p>
<p>This function is clearly deterministic and preserves equality, and it
is very efficient too. But how about the distribution – is it
uniform?</p>
<p>This depends on how the keys are distributed in the data, and this
depends on the application we have in mind. As an example, assume that
we only have even-numbered keys in our data – then only half of all
possible hash codes will be used.</p>
<p>A more realistic example is if we want to search for people using
their length. Person lengths are not uniformly distributed, but instead
they have a normal distribution. This means that the hash codes will
also be normal distributed, and there will be many collisions for
lengths that are closer to the average length.</p>
<p>However, despite the possibly skewed distribution, it is still quite
common to use a number as its own hash code. The reason for this is that
it is so simple and efficient to do so.</p>
<p>Note that this simple strategy works for all kinds of atomic values,
such as Unicode characters or enumeration types. All these are anyway
encoded as integers internally by the compiler.</p>
</section>
<section id="sec:floating-point-numbers" class="level4 unnumbered">
<h4 class="unnumbered">Floating point numbers</h4>
<p>There is an international standard for encoding floating point
numbers, called IEEE 754, which almost all modern processors use. The
details of the encoding are not important, what matters to us is that it
encodes every floating point number in a fixed number of bytes.</p>
<p>One very easy and common hash function for floating point numbers is
to simply use it as it is, but interpret the byte sequence as an
integer. This means that the floating point value 42.0 will <em>not</em>
have the hash code 42, but instead something completely different.
However, this is not a problem in our case since the only thing we need
to know is that it respects the requirements of a hash function. Just as
above, it is clearly both efficient, deterministic and preserves
equality, and the distribution is most definitely not worse than the
integer distribution.</p>
</section>
<section id="sec:strings-1" class="level4 unnumbered">
<h4 class="unnumbered">Strings</h4>
<p>But how can we handle more complex values, such as strings? A string
is a sequence of characters, of arbitrary length, so how can we
calculate a good hash code for a given string?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How about taking the hash code of the first character in the
string? No, that’s not a good idea because you will get an awful
distribution – all strings starting with “a” will get the same hash
code, such as “abacus”, “ape”, and “aperture”.</p></li>
<li><p>So, perhaps we can take the sum of the first, the middle and the
last characters? That’s better but still not very good – common strings
such as “state”, “summarise” and “signature” will get the same hash
code.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In both these cases the hash function will have a very skewed
distribution, and the main reason is that they don’t take every single
character into account. So an important rule of thumb is to use every
part of a complex object when calculating the hash code. But how should
these hash codes be combined? One way is to just sum all of them:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre
class="sourceCode pseudo"><code class="sourceCode pseudo"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">function</span> hashCode(<span class="bu">string</span>):</span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    code <span class="op">=</span> <span class="dv">0</span></span>
<span id="cb1-3"><a href="#cb1-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="cf">for</span> <span class="kw">each</span> char <span class="kw">in</span> <span class="bu">string</span>:</span>
<span id="cb1-4"><a href="#cb1-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>        code <span class="op">=</span> code <span class="op">+</span> hashCode(char)</span>
<span id="cb1-5"><a href="#cb1-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="cf">return</span> code</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This is much better than the previous suggestions, but still not very
good. Each character in the string will influence the final hash code,
but it does not take their internal order into account. Therefore all
the following strings will get the same hash code: “alter”, “later”, and
“alert”.</p>
</section>
<section id="sec:horners-method-for-strings-lists-and-other-sequences"
class="level4 unnumbered">
<h4 class="unnumbered">Horner’s method for strings, lists and other
sequences</h4>
<p>So we want our hash function to take all character in a string into
account, but also their position in the string. One common way is to
treat the sequence of characters,
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>s</mi><mo>=</mo><msub><mi>c</mi><mn>0</mn></msub><msub><mi>c</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mi>…</mi><msub><mi>c</mi><mi>n</mi></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">s=c_0c_1\ldots c_n</annotation></semantics></math>
as a polynomial over some constant
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>p</mi><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">p</annotation></semantics></math>,
like this:</p>
<p><math display="block" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>𝐡</mi><mo stretchy="false" form="prefix">(</mo><msub><mi>c</mi><mn>0</mn></msub><msub><mi>c</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><msub><mi>c</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mi>…</mi><msub><mi>c</mi><mi>n</mi></msub><mo stretchy="false" form="postfix">)</mo><mo>=</mo><msub><mi>c</mi><mn>0</mn></msub><mo>+</mo><msub><mi>c</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mi>p</mi><mo>+</mo><msub><mi>c</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><msup><mi>p</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>+</mo><msub><mi>c</mi><mn>3</mn></msub><msup><mi>p</mi><mn>3</mn></msup><mo>+</mo><mi>⋯</mi><mo>+</mo><msub><mi>c</mi><mi>n</mi></msub><msup><mi>p</mi><mi>n</mi></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">

</annotation></semantics></math></p>
<p>This kind of polynomial can be calculated efficiently using
<em>Horner’s method</em>, as a nested multiplication:</p>

</annotation></semantics></math></p>
<p>Which in turn is just a fancier way of writing a simple loop over all
characters, and accumulating the hash code:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre
class="sourceCode pseudo"><code class="sourceCode pseudo"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">function</span> hashCode(<span class="bu">string</span>):</span>

<span id="cb2-5"><a href="#cb2-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="cf">return</span> code</span></code></pre></div>
<p>To get the best distribution, we should use a not-too-small prime
number for
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>p</mi><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">p</annotation></semantics></math>.
(The standard hash function for strings in Java is exactly like this,
where they use
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>p</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>31</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">p=31</annotation></semantics></math>.)</p>
<p>Note that Horner’s method can be used for all kinds of sequences,
such as lists or tuples.</p>
</section>
<section id="sec:complex-values" class="level4 unnumbered">
<h4 class="unnumbered">Complex values</h4>
<p>So how can we handle complex values, such as general datatypes or
objects? E.g., how do we define a hash function for the following
datatype for person names:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre
class="sourceCode pseudo"><code class="sourceCode pseudo"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">datatype</span> Person:</span>
<span id="cb3-2"><a href="#cb3-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    firstName: String</span>
<span id="cb3-3"><a href="#cb3-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    middleName: String</span>
<span id="cb3-4"><a href="#cb3-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    lastName: String</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We can use the same strategy as we did for strings – simply treat the
three elements as a sequence and apply Horner’s method:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre
class="sourceCode pseudo"><code class="sourceCode pseudo"><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">datatype</span> Person:</span>

<p>However, sometimes we don’t want to use all instance variables when
calculating the hash code. Assume that we want to be able to search for
just the last name, i.e., to find all persons having the same last name.
Then we can build a hash table of persons, where the hash codes are only
calculated from the last names. If we want to also be able to search for
first names, we have to build <em>another</em> hash table – where the
hash codes are calculated from the first names.</p>
