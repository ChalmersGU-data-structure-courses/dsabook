Motivation</h2>
<p>You might think that with ever more powerful computers, program
efficiency is becoming less important. After all, processor speed and
memory size still continue to improve. Won’t today’s efficiency problem
be solved by tomorrow’s hardware?</p>
<p>The short answer to this question is <strong><em>no</em></strong>! It
is not at all certain that a twice as fast computer can solve twice as
large problems. On the contrary – most interesting problems are very
difficult, in the sense that if we increase the computing power we can
still only solve a very small increase in the size of the problem.</p>
<p>As we develop more powerful computers, our history so far has always
been to use that additional computing power to tackle more complex
problems, be it in the form of more sophisticated user interfaces,
bigger problem sizes, or new problems previously deemed computationally
infeasible. More complex problems demand more computation, making the
need for efficient programs even greater. Unfortunately, as tasks become
more complex, they become less like our everyday experience. So today’s
computer scientists must be trained to have a thorough understanding of
the principles behind efficient program design, because their ordinary
life experiences often do not apply when designing computer
programs.</p>
<p>In the most general sense, a <a href="section-14.html#data-structure"
class="term" title="The implementation for an ADT.">data structure</a>
is any data representation and its associated operations. Even an
integer or floating point number stored on the computer can be viewed as
a simple data structure. More commonly, people use the term “data
structure” to mean an organisation or structuring for a collection of
data items. A sorted list of integers stored in an array is an example
of such a structuring. These ideas are explored further in <a
href="section-1.7.html#sec:abstract-data-types">Section 1.7</a> about <a
href="section-14.html#abstract-data-type" class="term"
title="Abbreviated ADT. The specification of a data type within some language, independent of an implementation. The interface for the ADT is defined in terms of a type and a set of operations on that type. The behaviour of each operation is determined by its inputs and outputs. An ADT does not specify *how* the data type is implemented. These implementation details are hidden from the user of the ADT and protected from outside access, a concept referred to as encapsulation.">abstract
data types</a>.</p>
<p>Given sufficient space to store a collection of <a
href="section-14.html#data-item" class="term"
title="A piece of information or a record whose value is drawn from a type.">data
items</a>, it is always possible to search for specified items within
the collection, print or otherwise process the data items in any desired
order, or modify the value of any particular data item. The most obvious
example is an unsorted array containing all of the data items. It is
possible to perform all necessary operations on an unsorted array.
However, using the proper data structure can make the difference between
a program running in a few seconds and one requiring many days. For
example, searching for a given record in a <a
href="section-14.html#hash-table" class="term"
title="The data structure (usually an array) that stores data records for lookup using hashing.">hash
table</a> is much faster than searching for it in an unsorted array.</p>
<p>A solution is said to be <a href="section-14.html#efficient"
class="term"
title="A solution is said to be efficient if it solves the problem within the required resource constraints. A solution is sometimes said to be efficient if it requires fewer resources than known alternatives, regardless of whether it meets any particular requirements.">efficient</a>
if it solves the problem within the required <a
href="section-14.html#resource-constraints" class="term"
title="Examples of resource constraints include the total space available to store the data (possibly divided into separate main memory and disk space constraints) and the time allowed to perform each subtask.">resource
constraints</a>. Examples of resource constraints include the total
space available to store the data – possibly divided into separate main
memory and disk space constraints – and the time allowed to perform each
subtask. A solution is sometimes said to be efficient if it requires
fewer resources than known alternatives, regardless of whether it meets
any particular requirements. The <a href="section-14.html#cost"
class="term"
title="The amount of resources that given run of an algorithm consumes.">cost</a>
of a solution is the amount of resources that the solution consumes.
Most often, cost is measured in terms of one key resource such as time,
with the implied assumption that the solution meets the other resource
constraints.</p>
