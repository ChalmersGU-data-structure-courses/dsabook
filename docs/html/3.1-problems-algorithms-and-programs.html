Problems</h3>
<p>Programmers commonly deal with problems, algorithms, and computer
programs. These are three distinct concepts.</p>
<p>As your intuition would suggest, a <a href="10-glossary.html#problem"
class="term"
title="A task to be performed. It is best thought of as a function or a mapping of inputs to outputs.">problem</a>
is a task to be performed. It is best thought of in terms of inputs and
matching outputs. A problem definition should not include any
constraints on <em>how</em> the problem is to be solved. The solution
method should be developed only after the problem is precisely defined
and thoroughly understood. However, a problem definition should include
constraints on the resources that may be consumed by any acceptable
solution. For any problem to be solved by a computer, there are always
such constraints, whether stated or implied. For example, any computer
program may use only the main memory and disk space available, and it
must run in a “reasonable” amount of time.</p>
<p>Problems can be viewed as functions in the mathematical sense. A <a
href="10-glossary.html#function" class="term"
title="In mathematics, a matching between inputs (the domain) and outputs (the range). In programming, a subroutine that takes input parameters and uses them to compute and return a value. In this case, it is usually considered bad practice for a function to change any global variables (doing so is called a side effect).">function</a>
is a matching between inputs (the <a href="10-glossary.html#domain"
class="term"
title="The set of possible inputs to a function.">domain</a>) and
outputs (the <a href="10-glossary.html#range" class="term"
title="The set of possible outputs for a function.">range</a>). An input
to a function might be a single value or a collection of information.
The values making up an input are called the <a
href="10-glossary.html#parameter" class="term"
title="The values making up an input to a function.">parameters</a> of
the function. A specific selection of values for the parameters is
called an <a href="10-glossary.html#problem-instance" class="term"
title="A specific selection of values for the parameters to a problem. In other words, a specific set of inputs to a problem. A given problem instance has a size under some cost model.">instance</a>
of the problem. For example, the input parameter to a sorting function
might be an array of integers. A particular array of integers, with a
given size and specific values for each position in the array, would be
an instance of the sorting problem. Different instances might generate
the same output. However, any problem instance must always result in the
same output every time the function is computed using that particular
input.</p>
<p>This concept of all problems behaving like mathematical functions
might not match your intuition for the behavior of computer programs.
You might know of programs to which you can give the same input value on
two separate occasions, and two different outputs will result. For
example, if you type <code>date</code> to a typical Linux command line
prompt, you will get the current date. Naturally the date will be
different on different days, even though the same command is given.
However, there is obviously more to the input for the date program than
the command that you type to run the program. The date program computes
a function. In other words, on any particular day there can only be a
single answer returned by a properly running date program on a
completely specified input. For all computer programs, the output is
completely determined by the program’s full set of inputs. Even a
“random number generator” is completely determined by its inputs
(although some random number generating systems appear to get around
this by accepting a random input from a physical process beyond the
user’s control). The limits to what functions can be implemented by
programs is part of the domain of <a
href="10-glossary.html#computability" class="term"
title="A branch of computer science that deals with the theory of solving problems through computation. More specificially, it deals with the limits to what problems (functions) are computable. An example of a famous problem that cannot in principle be solved by a computer is the halting problem.">Computability</a>.</p>

Algorithms</h3>
<p>An <a href="10-glossary.html#algorithm" class="term"
title="A method or a process followed to solve a problem.">algorithm</a>
is a method or a process followed to solve a problem. If the problem is
viewed as a function, then an algorithm is an implementation for the
function that transforms an input to the corresponding output. A problem
can be solved by many different algorithms. A given algorithm solves
only one problem (i.e., computes a particular function). OpenDSA modules
cover many problems, and for several of these problems we will see more
than one algorithm. For the important problem of sorting there are over
a dozen commonly known algorithms!</p>
<p>The advantage of knowing several solutions to a problem is that
solution
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>𝐀</mi><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbf{A}</annotation></semantics></math>
might be more efficient than solution
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>𝐁</mi><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbf{B}</annotation></semantics></math>
for a specific variation of the problem, or for a specific class of
inputs to the problem, while solution
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>𝐁</mi><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbf{B}</annotation></semantics></math>
might be more efficient than
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>𝐀</mi><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbf{A}</annotation></semantics></math>
for another variation or class of inputs. For example, one sorting
algorithm might be the best for sorting a small collection of integers
(which is important if you need to do this many times). Another might be
the best for sorting a large collection of integers. A third might be
the best for sorting a collection of variable-length strings.</p>
<p>By definition, something can only be called an algorithm if it has
all of the following properties.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>It must be <em>correct</em>. In other words, it must compute the
desired function, converting each input to the correct output. Note that
every algorithm implements some function, because every algorithm maps
every input to some output (even if that output is a program crash). At
issue here is whether a given algorithm implements the <em>intended</em>
function.</li>
<li>It is composed of a series of <em>concrete steps</em>. Concrete
means that the action described by that step is completely understood -–
and doable -– by the person or machine that must perform the algorithm.
Each step must also be doable in a finite amount of time. Thus, the
algorithm gives us a “recipe” for solving the problem by performing a
series of steps, where each such step is within our capacity to perform.
The ability to perform a step can depend on who or what is intended to
execute the recipe. For example, the steps of a cookie recipe in a
cookbook might be considered sufficiently concrete for instructing a
human cook, but not for programming an automated cookie-making
factory.</li>
<li>There can be <em>no ambiguity</em> as to which step will be
performed next. Often it is the next step of the algorithm description.
Selection (e.g., the <code>if</code> statement) is normally a part of
any language for describing algorithms. Selection allows a choice for
which step will be performed next, but the selection process is
unambiguous at the time when the choice is made.</li>
<li>It must be composed of a <em>finite</em> number of steps. If the
description for the algorithm were made up of an infinite number of
steps, we could never hope to write it down, nor implement it as a
computer program. Most languages for describing algorithms (including
English and “pseudocode”) provide some way to perform repeated actions,
known as iteration. Examples of iteration in programming languages
include the <code>while</code> and <code>for</code> loop constructs.
Iteration allows for short descriptions, with the number of steps
actually performed controlled by the input.</li>
<li>It must <em>terminate</em>. In other words, it may not go into an
infinite loop.</li>
</ol>

Programs</h3>
<p>We often think of a computer <a href="10-glossary.html#program"
class="term"
title="An instance, or concrete representation, of an algorithm in some programming language.">program</a>
as an instance, or concrete representation, of an algorithm in some
programming language. Algorithms are usually presented in terms of
programs, or parts of programs. Naturally, there are many programs that
are instances of the same algorithm, because any modern computer
programming language can be used to implement the same collection of
algorithms (although some programming languages can make life easier for
the programmer). To simplify presentation, people often use the terms
“algorithm” and “program” interchangeably, despite the fact that they
are really separate concepts. By definition, an algorithm must provide
sufficient detail that it can be converted into a program when
needed.</p>
<p>The requirement that an algorithm must terminate means that not all
computer programs meet the technical definition of an algorithm. Your
operating system is one such program. However, you can think of the
various tasks for an operating system (each with associated inputs and
outputs) as individual problems, each solved by specific algorithms
implemented by a part of the operating system program, and each one of
which terminates once its output is produced.</p>
