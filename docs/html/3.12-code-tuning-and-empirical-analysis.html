Code Tuning and Empirical Analysis</h2>
<p>In practice, there is not such a big difference in running time
between an algorithm with growth rate

There is, however, an enormous difference in running time between
algorithms with growth rates of

As you shall see during the course of your study of common data
structures and algorithms, there are many problems whose obvious
solution requires

time, but that also have a solution requiring

time. Examples include sorting and searching, two of the most important
computer problems.</p>
<p>While not nearly so important as changing an algorithm to reduce its
growth rate, “code tuning” can also lead to dramatic improvements in
running time. Code tuning is the art of hand-optimizing a program to run
faster or require less storage. For many programs, code tuning can
reduce running time or cut the storage requirements by a factor of two
or more. Even speedups by a factor of five to ten are not uncommon.
Occasionally, you can get an even bigger speedup by converting from a
symbolic representation of the data to a numeric coding scheme on which
you can do direct computation.</p>
<div class="todo" type="text">
<p>Give an example of this type of representational change.</p>
</div>
<p>Here are some suggestions for ways to speed up your programs by code
tuning. The most important thing to realize is that most statements in a
program do not have much effect on the running time of that program.
There are normally just a few key subroutines, possibly even key lines
of code within the key subroutines, that account for most of the running
time. There is little point to cutting in half the running time of a
subroutine that accounts for only 1% of the total running time. Focus
your attention on those parts of the program that have the most
impact.</p>
<p>When tuning code, it is important to gather good timing statistics.
Many compilers and operating systems include profilers and other special
tools to help gather information on both time and space use. These are
invaluable when trying to make a program more efficient, because they
can tell you where to invest your effort.</p>
<p>A lot of code tuning is based on the principle of avoiding work
rather than speeding up work. A common situation occurs when we can test
for a condition that lets us skip some work. However, such a test is
never completely free. Care must be taken that the cost of the test does
not exceed the amount of work saved. While one test might be cheaper
than the work potentially saved, the test must always be made and the
work can be avoided only some fraction of the time.</p>
<section id="example-16" class="level4 unnumbered topic">
<h4 class="unnumbered">Example</h4>
<p>A common operation in computer graphics applications is to find which
among a set of complex objects contains a given point in space. Many
useful data structures and algorithms have been developed to deal with
variations of this problem. Most such implementations involve the
following tuning step. Directly testing whether a given complex object
contains the point in question is relatively expensive. Instead, we can
screen for whether the point is contained within a <a href="10-glossary.html#bounding-box" class="term">bounding box</a> for the object. The bounding box is
simply the smallest rectangle (usually defined to have sides
perpendicular to the
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>x</mi><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x</annotation></semantics></math>
and
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>y</mi><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">y</annotation></semantics></math>
axes) that contains the object. If the point is not in the bounding box,
then it cannot be in the object. If the point is in the bounding box,
only then would we conduct the full comparison of the object versus the
point. Note that if the point is outside the bounding box, we saved time
because the bounding box test is cheaper than the comparison of the full
object versus the point. But if the point is inside the bounding box,
then that test is redundant because we still have to compare the point
against the object. Typically the amount of work avoided by making this
test is greater than the cost of making the test on every object.</p>
</section>
<p>Be careful not to use tricks that make the program unreadable. Most
code tuning is simply cleaning up a carelessly written program, not
taking a clear program and adding tricks. In particular, you should
develop an appreciation for the capabilities of modern compilers to make
extremely good optimizations of expressions. “Optimization of
expressions” here means a rearrangement of arithmetic or logical
expressions to run more efficiently. Be careful not to damage the
compiler’s ability to do such optimizations for you in an effort to
optimize the expression yourself. Always check that your “optimizations”
really do improve the program by running the program before and after
the change on a suitable benchmark set of input. Many times I have been
wrong about the positive effects of code tuning in my own programs. Most
often I am wrong when I try to optimize an expression. It is hard to do
better than the compiler.</p>
<p>The greatest time and space improvements come from a better data
structure or algorithm. The most important rule of code tuning is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>First tune the algorithm, then tune the code.</strong></p>

class="header-section-number">3.12.1</span> Empirical Analysis</h3>
<p><a href="3-algorithm-analysis.html#algorithm-analysis"
class="term">Asymptotic algorithm analysis</a> is an analytic tool,
whereby we model the key aspects of an algorithm to determine the growth
rate of the algorithm as the input size grows. It has proved hugely
practical, guiding developers to use more efficient algorithms. But it
is really an <a href="10-glossary.html#estimation" class="term">estimation</a> technique, and it has
its limitations. These include the effects at small problem size,
determining the finer distinctions between algorithms with the same
growth rate, and the inherent difficulty of doing mathematical modeling
for more complex problems.</p>
<p>An alternative to analytical approaches are empirical ones. The most
obvious empirical approach is simply to run two competitors and see
which performs better. In this way we might overcome the deficiencies of
analytical approaches.</p>
<p>Be warned that comparative timing of programs is a difficult
business, often subject to experimental errors arising from uncontrolled
factors (system load, the language or compiler used, etc.). The most
important concern is that you might be biased in favor of one of the
programs. If you are biased, this is certain to be reflected in the
timings. One look at competing software or hardware vendors’
advertisements should convince you of this. The most common pitfall when
writing two programs to compare their performance is that one receives
more code-tuning effort than the other, since code tuning can often
reduce running time by a factor of five to ten. If the running times for
two programs differ by a constant factor regardless of input size (i.e.,
their growth rates are the same), then differences in code tuning might
account for any difference in running time. Be suspicious of empirical
comparisons in this situation.</p>
<p>Another approach to analytical analysis is simulation. The idea of
simulation is to model the problem with a computer program and then run
it to get a result. In the context of algorithm analysis, simulation is
distinct from empirical comparison of two competitors because the
purpose of the simulation is to perform analysis that might otherwise be
too difficult. A good example of this appears in the following
figure.</p>

</div>
<p>This figure shows the cost for inserting or deleting a record from a
<a href="8-hashing.html#hashing">hash table</a> under two different
assumptions for the policy used to find a free slot in the table. The
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>y</mi><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">y</annotation></semantics></math>
axes is the cost in number of hash table slots evaluated, and the
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>x</mi><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x</annotation></semantics></math>
axes is the percentage of slots in the table that are full. The
mathematical equations for these curves can be determined, but this is
not so easy. A reasonable alternative is to write simple variations on
hashing. By timing the cost of the program for various loading
conditions, it is not difficult to construct a plot similar to this one.
The purpose of this analysis was not to determine which approach to
hashing is most efficient, so we are not doing empirical comparison of
hashing alternatives. Instead, the purpose was to analyze the proper
loading factor that would be used in an efficient hashing system to
balance time cost versus hash table size (space cost).</p>
