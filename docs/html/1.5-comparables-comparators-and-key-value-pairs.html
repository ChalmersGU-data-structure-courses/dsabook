Comparables, Comparators and Key-Value Pairs</h2>
<p>If we want to sort some things, we have to be able to compare them,
to decide which one is bigger. How do we compare two things? If all that
we wanted to sort or search for was simple integer values, this would
not be an interesting question. We can just use standard comparison
operators like “&lt;” or “&gt;”. Even if we wanted to store strings,
most programming languages give us built-in functions for comparing
strings alphabetically. But we do not usually want to store just
integers or strings in a data structure. Usually we want to store
records, where a record is made up of multiple values, such as a name,
an address, and a phone number. In that case, how can we “compare”
records to decide which one is “smaller”? We cannot just use “&lt;” to
compare the records! Nearly always in this situation, we are actually
interested in sorting the records based on the values of one particular
field used to represent the record, which itself is something simple
like an integer. This field is referred to as the <a
href="10-glossary.html#key" class="term"
title="A field or part of a larger record used to represent that record for the purpose of searching or comparing. Another term for search key.">key</a>
for the record.</p>
<p>Likewise, if we want to search for a given record in a database, how
should we describe what we are looking for? A database record could
simply be a number, or it could be quite complicated, such as a payroll
record with many fields of varying types. We do not want to describe
what we are looking for by detailing and matching the entire contents of
the record. If we knew everything about the record already, we probably
would not need to look for it. Instead, we typically define what record
we want in terms of a key value. For example, if searching for payroll
records, we might wish to search for the record that matches a
particular ID number. In this example the ID number is the <a
href="10-glossary.html#search-key" class="term"
title="A field or part of a record that is used to represent the record when searching. For example, in a database of customer records, we might want to search by name. In this case the name field is used as the search key.">search
key</a>.</p>

<h3 data-number="1.5.1"><span class="header-section-number">1.5.1</span>
Comparables</h3>
<p>To implement sorting or searching, we require that keys be <a
href="10-glossary.html#comparable" class="term"
title="The concept that two objects can be compared to determine if they are equal or not, or to determine which one is greater than the other. In set notation, elements $x$ and $y$ of a set are comparable under a given relation $R$ if either $xRy$ or $yRx$. To be reliably compared for a greater/lesser relationship, the values being compared must belong to a total order. In programming, the property of a data type such that two elements of the type can be compared to determine if they are the same (a weaker version), or which of the two is larger (a stronger version). `Comparable` is also the name of an interface in Java that asserts a comparable relationship between objects within a class, and `.compareTo()` is the `Comparable` interface method that implements the actual comparison between two objects of the class.">comparable</a>.
At a minimum, we must be able to take two keys and reliably determine
whether they are equal or not. That is enough to enable a <a
href="2.1-searching-in-an-array.html#sequential-search" class="term"
title="The simplest search algorithm: In an array, simply look at the array elements in the order that they appear.">sequential
search</a> through a database of records and find one that matches a
given key. However, we typically would like for the keys to define a <a
href="10-glossary.html#total-order" class="term"
title="A binary relation on a set where every pair of distinct elements in the set are comparable (that is, one can determine which of the two is greater than the other).">total
order</a>, which means that we can always tell which of two keys is
greater than the other. Using key types with total orderings gives the
database implementor the opportunity to organize a collection of records
in a way that makes searching more efficient. An example is storing the
records in sorted order in an array, which permits a <a
href="2.1-searching-in-an-array.html#binary-search" class="term"
title="A standard recursive algorithm for finding the record with a given search key value within a sorted list. It runs in $O(\log n)$ time. At each step, look at the middle of the current sublist, and throw away the half of the records whose keys are either too small or too large.">binary
search</a>. Fortunately, in practice most fields of most records consist
of simple data types with natural total orders. For example, integers,
floats, doubles, and character strings all are totally ordered.</p>
<p>But if we want to write a general purpose sorting or searching
function, we need a general way to get the key for the record. We could
insist that every record have a particular method called
<code>.key()</code>. That seems like a good name for it!</p>
<p>Some languages like Java, Python and C++ have special infrastructure
for supporting this (such as the <code>Comparable</code> interface in
Java, which has the <code>.compareTo()</code> method for defining the
exact process by which two objects are compared; or the overloaded
methods <code>__eq__</code>, <code>__lt__</code>, etc, used by Python).
But many languages do not, such as C and Javascript.</p>
<p>But what if the programmer wants to sort the record now using one
field as the key, and later using another field? Or search sometimes on
one key, and at other times on another? The problem is that the
“keyness” of a given field is not an inherent property within the
record, but rather depends on the context. So, you cannot always count
on being able to use your favorite method name (or even the comparable
interface) to extract the desired key value.</p>

<h3 data-number="1.5.2"><span class="header-section-number">1.5.2</span>
Comparators</h3>
<p>Another, more general approach is to supply a function or class –
called a <a href="10-glossary.html#comparator" class="term"
title="A function given as a parameter to a method of a library (or alternatively, a parameter for a C++ template or a Java generic). The comparator function concept provides a generic way to encapulate the process of performing a comparison between two objects of a specific type. For example, if we want to write a generic sorting routine, that can handle any record type, we can require that the user of the sorting routine passes in a comparator function to define how records in the collection are to be compared.">comparator</a>
– whose job is to extract the key from the record. A comparator function
can be passed in as a parameter, such as in a call to a sorting
function. In this case, the comparator function would be invoked on two
records whenever they need to be compared. In this way, different
comparator functions can be passed in to handle different record types
or different fields within a record. In Java (with generics) or C++
(with templates), a comparator class can be a parameter for another
class definition. For example, a BST could take a comparator class as a
generics parameter in Java. This comparator class would be responsible
for dealing with the comparison of two records.</p>

<h3 data-number="1.5.3"><span class="header-section-number">1.5.3</span>
Key-Value Pairs</h3>
<p>One good general-purpose solution is to explicitly store <a
href="10-glossary.html#key-value-pair" class="term"
title="A standard solution for solving the problem of how to relate a key value to a record (or how to find the key for a given record) within the context of a particular index. The idea is to simply store as records in the index pairs of keys and records. Specifically, the index will typically store a copy of the key along with a reference to the record. The other standard solution to this problem is to pass a comparator function to the index.">key-value
pairs</a> in the data structure. For example, if we want to sort a bunch
of records, we can store them in an array where every array entry
contains both a key value for the record and a pointer to the record
itself.</p>
<p>The main places where we will need to be concerned with comparing
records and extracting keys is for various map implementations and
sorting algorithms. Here is a simple class for representing key-value
pairs:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre
class="sourceCode pseudo"><code class="sourceCode pseudo"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">class</span> <span class="bu">KVPair</span>:</span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    key    <span class="co">// the search key</span></span>
<span id="cb1-3"><a href="#cb1-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    value  <span class="co">// the value associated with the key</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Note that in Python it’s probably easier to just use a pair
<code>(key,value)</code>, but not all languages (read: Java) have that
possibility. So we declare a class <strong>KVPair</strong> thart we will
use in our example code.</p>
<p>Using this we can easily implement a <strong>Map</strong> from an
underlying <strong>List</strong>, which we will discuss further in the
<a
href="4.6-implementing-maps-using-lists.html#implementing-maps-using-lists">chapter
about linear structures</a>.</p>

Sorting using Comparables</h3>
<p>To keep them clear and simple, visualizations for sorting algorithms
will usually show them as operating on integer values stored in an
array. But almost never do people really want to sort an array of
integers. But to be useful, a real sorting algorithm typically has to
deal with the fact that it is sorting a collection of records. A
general-purpose sorting routine meant to operate on multiple record
types would have to be written in a way to deal with the generic
comparison problem. But as long as the elements of the array supports
the <strong>Comparable</strong> interface, we can still use the standard
comparison operators when sorting.</p>
