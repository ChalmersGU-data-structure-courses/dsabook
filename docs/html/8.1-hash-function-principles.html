Hash Function Principles</h2>
<p>Hashing generally takes records whose key values come from a large
range and stores those records in a table with a relatively small number
of slots. Collisions occur when two records hash to the same slot in the
table. If we are careful – or lucky – when selecting a hash function,
then the actual number of collisions will be few. Unfortunately, even
under the best of circumstances, collisions are nearly unavoidable. To
illustrate, consider a classroom full of students. What is the
probability that some pair of students shares the same birthday (i.e.,
the same day of the year, not necessarily the same year)? If there are
23 students, then the odds are about even that two will share a
birthday. This is despite the fact that there are 365 days in which
students can have birthdays (ignoring leap years). On most days, no
student in the class has a birthday. With more students, the probability
of a shared birthday increases. The mapping of students to days based on
their birthday is similar to assigning records to slots in a table (of
size 365) using the birthday as a hash function. Note that this
observation tells us nothing about <em>which</em> students share a
birthday, or on <em>which</em> days of the year shared birthdays
fall.</p>
<p>Try it for yourself. You can use the calculator to see the
probability of a collision. The default values are set to show the
number of people in a room such that the chance of a duplicate is just
over 50%. But you can set any table size and any number of records to
determine the probability of a collision under those conditions.</p>

<p>To be practical, a database organized by hashing must store records
in a hash table that is not so large that it wastes space. To balance
time and space efficiency, this means that the hash table should be <a
href="8.8-analysis-of-open-addressing.html#analysis-of-open-addressing">around
half full</a>. Because collisions are extremely likely to occur under
these conditions (by chance, any record inserted into a table that is
half full should have a collision half of the time), does this mean that
we need not worry about how well a hash function does at avoiding
collisions? Absolutely not. The difference between using a good hash
function and a bad hash function makes a big difference in practice in
the number of records that must be examined when searching or inserting
to the table. Technically, any function that maps all possible key
values to a slot in the hash table is a hash function. In the extreme
case, even a function that maps all records to the same slot in the
array is a hash function, but it does nothing to help us find records
during a search operation.</p>
<p>We would like to pick a hash function that maps keys to slots in a
way that makes each slot in the hash table have equal probablility of
being filled for the actual set keys being used. Unfortunately, we
normally have no control over the distribution of key values for the
actual records in a given database or collection. So how well any
particular hash function does depends on the actual distribution of the
keys used within the allowable key range. In some cases, incoming data
are well distributed across their key range. For example, if the input
is a set of random numbers selected uniformly from the key range, any
hash function that assigns the key range so that each slot in the hash
table receives an equal share of the range will likely also distribute
the input records uniformly within the table. However, in many
applications the incoming records are highly clustered or otherwise
poorly distributed. When input records are not well distributed
throughout the key range it can be difficult to devise a hash function
that does a good job of distributing the records throughout the table,
especially if the input distribution is not known in advance.</p>
<p>There are many reasons why data values might be poorly
distributed.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Natural frequency distributions tend to follow a common pattern
where a few of the entities occur frequently while most entities occur
relatively rarely. For example, consider the populations of the 100
largest cities in the United States. If you plot these populations on a
numberline, most of them will be clustered toward the low side, with a
few outliers on the high side. This is an example of a Zipf
distribution. Viewed the other way, the home town for a given person is
far more likely to be a particular large city than a particular small
town.</li>
<li>Collected data are likely to be skewed in some way. Field samples
might be rounded to, say, the nearest 5 (i.e., all numbers end in 5 or
0).</li>
<li>If the input is a collection of common English words, the beginning
letter will be poorly distributed.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that for items 2 and 3 on this list, either high- or low-order
bits of the key are poorly distributed.</p>
<p>When designing hash functions, we are generally faced with one of two
situations:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>We know nothing about the distribution of the incoming keys. In this
case, we wish to select a hash function that evenly distributes the key
range across the hash table, while avoiding obvious opportunities for
clustering such as hash functions that are sensitive to the high- or
low-order bits of the key value.</li>
<li>We know something about the distribution of the incoming keys. In
this case, we should use a distribution-dependent hash function that
avoids assigning clusters of related key values to the same hash table
slot. For example, if hashing English words, we should <em>not</em> hash
on the value of the first character because this is likely to be
unevenly distributed.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the next module, you will see several examples of hash functions
that illustrate these points.</p>
