Abstract Data Types</h2>
<p>This section presents terminology and definitions related to
techniques for managing the tremendous complexity of computer programs.
It also presents working definitions for the fundamental but somewhat
slippery terms “<a href="10-glossary.html#data-item" class="term"
title="A piece of information or a record whose value is drawn from a type.">data
item</a>” and “<a href="10-glossary.html#data-structure" class="term"
title="The implementation for an ADT.">data structure</a>”. We begin
with the basic elements on which data structures are built.</p>
<p>A <a href="10-glossary.html#type" class="term"
title="A collection of values.">type</a> is a collection of values. For
example, the Boolean type consists of the values <code>true</code> and
<code>false</code>. The integers also form a type. An integer is a <a
href="10-glossary.html#simple-type" class="term"
title="A data type whose values contain no subparts. An example is the integers.">simple
type</a> because its values contain no subparts. A bank account record
will typically contain several pieces of information such as name,
address, account number, and account balance. Such a record is an
example of an <a href="10-glossary.html#aggregate-type" class="term"
title="A data type whose members have subparts. For example, a typical database record.">aggregate
type</a> or <a href="10-glossary.html#composite-type" class="term"
title="A data type whose members have subparts. For example, a typical database record.">composite
type</a>. A <a href="10-glossary.html#data-item" class="term"
title="A piece of information or a record whose value is drawn from a type.">data
item</a> is a piece of information or a record whose value is drawn from
a type. A data item is said to be a <a href="10-glossary.html#member"
class="term"
title="In set notation, this is a synonym for element. In abstract design, a data item is a member of a type. In an object-oriented language, data members are data fields in an object.">member</a>
of a type.</p>
<p>A <a href="10-glossary.html#data-type" class="term"
title="A type together with a collection of operations to manipulate the type.">data
type</a> is a type together with a collection of operations to
manipulate the type. For example, an integer variable is a member of the
integer data type. Addition is an example of an operation on the integer
data type.</p>
<p>A distinction should be made between the logical concept of a data
type and its physical implementation in a computer program. For example,
there are two traditional implementations for the list data type: the
linked list and the array-based list. The list data type can therefore
be implemented using a linked list or an array. But we don’t need to
know how the list is implemented when we wish to use a list to help in a
more complex design. For example, a list might be used to help implement
a <a href="9.2-graph-implementations.html#graph-implementations">graph
data structure</a>.</p>
<p>As another example, the term “array” could refer either to a data
type or an implementation. “Array” is commonly used in computer
programming to mean a contiguous block of memory locations, where each
memory location stores one fixed-length data item. By this meaning, an
array is a physical data structure. However, array can also mean a
logical data type composed of a (typically homogeneous) collection of
data items, with each data item identified by an index number. It is
possible to implement arrays in many different ways besides as a block
of contiguous memory locations. The <a
href="10-glossary.html#sparse-matrix" class="term"
title="A matrix whose values are mostly zero. There are a number of data structures that have been developed to store sparse matrices, with the goal of reducing the amount of space required to represent it as compared to simply using a regular matrix representation that stores a value for every matrix position.">sparse
matrix</a> refers to a large, two-dimensional array that stores only a
relatively few non-zero values. This is often implemented with a linked
structure, or possibly using a <a href="8-hashing.html#hashing">hash
table</a>. But it could be implemented with an interface that uses
traditional row and column indices, thus appearing to the user in the
same way that it would if it had been implemented as a block of
contiguous memory locations.</p>
<p>An <a href="10-glossary.html#abstract-data-type" class="term"
title="Abbreviated ADT. The specification of a data type within some language, independent of an implementation. The interface for the ADT is defined in terms of a type and a set of operations on that type. The behavior of each operation is determined by its inputs and outputs.

These implementation details are hidden from the user of the ADT and protected from outside access, a concept referred to as encapsulation.">abstract

<section id="example-a" class="level4 unnumbered topic">
<h4 class="unnumbered">Example A</h4>
<p>The mathematical concept of an integer, along with operations that
manipulate integers, form a data type. The <code>int</code> variable
type is a physical representation of the abstract integer. The
<code>int</code> variable type, along with the operations that act on an
<code>int</code> variable, form an ADT. Unfortunately, the
<code>int</code> implementation is not completely true to the abstract
integer, as there are limitations on the range of values an
<code>int</code> variable can store. If these limitations prove
unacceptable, then some other representation for the ADT “integer” must
be devised, and a new implementation must be used for the associated
operations.</p>
</section>
<section id="example-b" class="level4 unnumbered topic">
<h4 class="unnumbered">Example B</h4>
<p>An ADT for a list of integers might specify the following
operations:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Insert a new integer at a particular position in the list.</li>
<li>Return <code>true</code> if the list is empty.</li>
<li>Reinitialize the list.</li>
<li>Return the number of integers currently in the list.</li>
<li>Retrieve the integer at a particular position in the list.</li>
<li>Delete the integer at a particular position in the list.</li>
</ol>
<p>From this description, the input and output of each operation should
be clear, but the implementation for lists has not been specified.</p>
</section>
<p>There are often several possible implementations of the same ADT. The
reason for this is that it is usually not possible to implement all
operations efficiently, and often there is a trade off: As an example,
it could be the case that you can make operation A or B efficient, but
not both. And some applications might use A more often than B, while
other applications use B more often. Another example is that one
implementation could be efficient for small datasets (thousands of
elements), while another implementation is more efficient for large
datasets (millions of elements). Therefore there is usually a need for
several different implementations of the same ADT.</p>
<section id="example-c" class="level4 unnumbered topic">
<h4 class="unnumbered">Example C</h4>
<p>Two popular implementations for large disk-based database
applications are <a href="8-hashing.html#hashing">hashing</a> and the <a
href="10-glossary.html#b-tree" class="term"
title="A method for indexing a large collection of records. A B-tree is a balanced tree that typically has high branching factor (commonly as much as 100 children per internal node), causing the tree to be very shallow. When stored on disk, the node size is selected to be same as the desired unit of I/O (hence some multiple of the disk sector size). This makes it easy to gain access to the record associated with a given search key stored in the tree with few disk accesses. The most commonly implemented variant of the B-tree is the B+ tree.">B-tree</a>.
Both support efficient insertion and deletion of records, and both
support exact-match queries. However, hashing is more efficient than the
B-tree for exact-match queries. On the other hand, the B-tree can
perform range queries efficiently, while hashing is hopelessly
inefficient for range queries. Thus, if the database application limits
searches to exact-match queries, hashing is preferred. On the other
hand, if the application requires support for range queries, the B-tree
is preferred. Despite these performance issues, both implementations
solve versions of the same problem: updating and searching a large
collection of records.</p>
</section>
<p>The concept of an ADT can help us to focus on key issues even in
non-computing applications.</p>
<section id="example-d" class="level4 unnumbered topic">
<h4 class="unnumbered">Example D</h4>
<p>When operating a car, the primary activities are steering,
accelerating, and braking. On nearly all passenger cars, you steer by
turning the steering wheel, accelerate by pushing the gas pedal, and
brake by pushing the brake pedal. This design for cars can be viewed as
an ADT with operations “steer”, “accelerate”, and “brake”. Two cars
might implement these operations in radically different ways, say with
different types of engine, or front- versus rear-wheel drive. Yet, most
drivers can operate many different cars because the ADT presents a
uniform method of operation that does not require the driver to
understand the specifics of any particular engine or drive design. These
differences are deliberately hidden.</p>
</section>
<p>The concept of an ADT is one instance of an important principle that
must be understood by any successful computer scientist: managing
complexity through abstraction. A central theme of computer science is
complexity and techniques for handling it. Humans deal with complexity
by assigning a label to an assembly of objects or concepts and then
manipulating the label in place of the assembly. Cognitive psychologists
call such a label a <em>metaphor</em>. A particular label might be
related to other pieces of information or other labels. This collection
can in turn be given a label, forming a hierarchy of concepts and
labels. This hierarchy of labels allows us to focus on important issues
while ignoring unnecessary details.</p>
<section id="example-e" class="level4 unnumbered topic">
<h4 class="unnumbered">Example E</h4>
<p>We apply the label “hard drive” to a collection of hardware that
manipulates data on a particular type of storage device, and we apply
the label “CPU” to the hardware that controls execution of computer
instructions. These and other labels are gathered together under the
label “computer”. Because even the smallest home computers today have
millions of components, some form of abstraction is necessary to
comprehend how a computer operates.</p>
</section>
<p>Consider how you might go about the process of designing a complex
computer program that implements and manipulates an ADT. The ADT is
implemented in one part of the program by a particular data structure.
While designing those parts of the program that use the ADT, you can
think in terms of operations on the data type without concern for the
data structure’s implementation. Without this ability to simplify your
thinking about a complex program, you would have no hope of
understanding or implementing it.</p>
<section id="example-f" class="level4 unnumbered topic">
<h4 class="unnumbered">Example F</h4>
<p>Consider the design for a relatively simple database system stored on
disk. Typically, records on disk in such a program are accessed through
a <a href="10-glossary.html#buffer-pool" class="term"
title="A collection of one or more buffers. The buffer pool is an example of a cache. It is stored in primary storage, and holds data that is expected to be used in the near future. When a data value is requested, the buffer pool is searched first. If the value is found in the buffer pool, then secondary storage need not be accessed. If the value is not found in the buffer pool, then it must be fetched from secondary storage. A number of traditional heuristics have been developed for deciding which data to flush from the buffer pool when new data must be stored, such as least recently used.">buffer
pool</a> rather than directly. Variable length records might use a <a
href="10-glossary.html#memory-manager" class="term"
title="Functionality for managing a memory pool. Typically, the memory pool is viewed as an array of bytes by the memory manager. The client of the memory manager will request a collection of (adjacent) bytes of some size, and release the bytes for reuse when the space is no longer needed. The memory manager should not know anything about the interpretation of the data that is being stored by the client into the memory pool. Depending on the precise implementation, the client might pass in the data to be stored, in which case the memory manager will deal with the actual copy of the data into the memory pool. The memory manager will return to the client a handle that can later be used by the client to retrieve the data.">memory
manager</a> to find an appropriate location within the disk file to
place the record. Multiple <a href="10-glossary.html#indexing"
class="term"
title="The process of associating a search key with the location of a corresponding data record. The two defining points to the concept of an index is the association of a key with a record, and the fact that the index does not actually store the record itself but rather it stores a reference to the record. In this way, a collection of records can be supported by multiple indices, typically a separate index for each key field in the record.">index
structures</a> will typically be used to support access to a collection
of records using multiple <a href="10-glossary.html#search-key"
class="term"
title="A field or part of a record that is used to represent the record when searching. For example, in a database of customer records, we might want to search by name. In this case the name field is used as the search key.">search
keys</a>. Thus, we have a chain of classes, each with its own
responsibilities and access privileges. A database query from a user is
implemented by searching an index structure. This index requests access
to the record by means of a request to the buffer pool. If a record is
being inserted or deleted, such a request goes through the memory
manager, which in turn interacts with the buffer pool to gain access to
the disk file. A program such as this is far too complex for nearly any
human programmer to keep all of the details in their head at once. The
only way to design and implement such a program is through proper use of
abstraction and metaphors. In object-oriented programming, such
abstraction is handled using classes.</p>
</section>
<p>Data types have both a <a href="10-glossary.html#logical-form"
class="term"
title="The definition for a data type in terms of an ADT. Contrast to the physical form for the data type.">logical
form</a> and a <a href="10-glossary.html#physical-form" class="term"
title="The implementation of a data type as a data structure. Contrast to the logical form for the data type.">physical
form</a>. The definition of the data type in terms of an ADT is its
logical form. The implementation of the data type as a data structure is
its physical form. Sometimes you might see the term <em>concrete
implementation</em>, but the word concrete is redundant. The figure
below illustrates this relationship between logical and physical forms
for data types. When you implement an ADT, you are dealing with the
physical form of the associated data type. When you use an ADT elsewhere
in your program, you are concerned with the associated data type’s
logical form. Some sections of this book focus on physical
implementations for a given data structure. Other sections use the
logical ADT for the data structure in the context of a higher-level
task.</p>

</section>
<p>As we saw, the ADT defines the logical form of the data type, while
the data structure implements the physical form of the data type. Users
of an ADT are typically programmers working in the same language as the
implementer of the ADT. Typically, these programmers want to use the ADT
as a component in another application. The interface to an ADT is also
commonly referred to as the Application Programmer Interface, or API,
for the ADT. The interface becomes a form of communication between two
programmers.</p>

class. The logical form of the list is defined by the public functions,
their inputs, and their outputs that define the class. This might be all
that you know about the list class implementation, and this should be
all you need to know. Within the class, a variety of physical
implementations for lists is possible.</p>
