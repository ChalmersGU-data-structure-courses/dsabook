Sorting, part 2: Divide-and-conquer algorithms</h1>
<p>In the previous chapter we presented three simple and relatively slow
sorting algorithms, with <a href="section-14.html#quadratic-growth-rate"
class="term"
title="A growth rate function of the form $cn^2$ where $n$ is the input size and $c$ is a constant.">quadratic</a>
runtime behaviour. Now we will introduce two algorithms with
considerably better performance, with <a
href="section-14.html#linearithmic-growth-rate" class="term"
title="For input size $n$, a growth rate of $cn \log n$ (for $c$ any positive constant). In other words, the cost of the associated function is slightly larger than linear on the input size.">linearithmic</a>
worst-case or average-case running time: <a
href="section-14.html#mergesort" class="term"
title="A sorting algorithm that requires $O(n \log n)$ in the best, average, and worst cases. Conceptually it is simple: Split the list in half, sort the halves, then merge them together. It is a bit complicated to implement efficiently on an array.">Mergesort</a>
and <a href="section-14.html#quicksort" class="term"
title="A sort that is $O(n \log n)$ in the best and average cases, though $O(n^2)$ in the worst case. However, a reasonable implmentation will make the worst case occur under exceedingly rare circumstances. Due to its tight inner loop, it tends to run better than any other known sort in general cases. Thus, it is a popular sort to use in code libraries. It works by divide and conquer, by selecting a pivot value, splitting the list into parts that are either less than or greater than the pivot, and then sorting the two parts.">Quicksort</a>.
In addition we will briefly discuss some special-purpose sorting
algorithms, such as <a href="section-14.html#radix-sort" class="term"
title="A sorting algorithm that works by processing records with $k$ digit keys in $k$ passes, where each pass sorts the records according to the current digit. At the end of the process, the records will be sorted. This can be efficient if the number of digits is small compared to the number of records. However, if the $n$ records all have unique key values, than at least $\Omega(\log n)$ digits are required, leading to an $\Omega(n \log n)$ sorting algorithm that tends to be much slower than other sorting algorithms like Quicksort or Mergesort.">Radix
sort</a>.</p>
<p>Both these algorithms make use of a basic strategy for algorithm
design, which is called <a href="section-14.html#divide-and-conquer"
class="term"
title="A technique for designing algorithms where a solution is found by breaking the problem into smaller (similar) subproblems, solving the subproblems, then combining the subproblem solutions to form the solution to the original problem. This process is often implemented using recursion.">divide
and conquer</a>. The basic idea is to divide a big problem (how to sort
a big array) into subproblems that can be solved independently (how to
sort two smaller arrays). The main difference between the algorithms is
how they do the dividing: <a href="section-14.html#mergesort"
class="term"
title="A sorting algorithm that requires $O(n \log n)$ in the best, average, and worst cases. Conceptually it is simple: Split the list in half, sort the halves, then merge them together. It is a bit complicated to implement efficiently on an array.">Mergesort</a>
divides the array in two equal-sized halves, while <a
href="section-14.html#quicksort" class="term"
title="A sort that is $O(n \log n)$ in the best and average cases, though $O(n^2)$ in the worst case.

It works by divide and conquer, by selecting a pivot value, splitting the list into parts that are either less than or greater than the pivot, and then sorting the two parts.">Quicksort</a>
divides the array into the big values and the small values. <a

title="A sorting algorithm that works by processing records with $k$ digit keys in $k$ passes, where each pass sorts the records according to the current digit.

sort</a> in turn divides the problem by working on one digit of the key
at a time.</p>
<p>We will also make use of different algorithm analysis techniques.
Quicksort illustrates that it is possible for an algorithm to have an <a
href="section-14.html#average-case" class="term"
title="In algorithm analysis, specifically complexity of an algorithm, the average of the costs for all problem instances of a given input size $n$. If not all problem instances have equal probability of occurring, then the average case must be calculated using a weighted average that is specified with the problem (for example, every input may be equally likely). Every input size $n$ has its own average case. We **never** consider the average case as removed from input size.">average
case</a> whose growth rate is significantly smaller than its <a
href="section-14.html#worst-case" class="term"
title="In algorithm analysis, specifically complexity of an algorithm, the problem instance from among all problem instances for a given input size $n$ that has the greatest cost. Every input size $n$ has its own worst case. We **never** consider the worst case as removed from input size.">worst
case</a>. We can use code tuning to improve these algorithms, by falling
back to a simpler algorithm (such as <a
href="section-14.html#insertion-sort" class="term"
title="A sorting algorithm with $O(n^2)$ average and worst case cost, and $O(n)$ best case cost. This best case cost makes it useful when we have reason to expect the input to be nearly sorted.">Insertion
sort</a>) when the subarray is small enough.</p>
