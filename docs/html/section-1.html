Introduction</h1>
<p>How many cities with more than 100,000 people lie within 200
kilometres of Paris, France? How many people in Swedish towns with less
than 50,000 people earn less than 50% of the average income of people in
Sweden? How much more CO<sub>2</sub> will be emitted if I travel by
plane from Gothenburg, Sweden, to Düsseldorf, Germany, compared to if I
take the train? How can I see if a text contains plagiarism, i.e., if it
copied some parts from another existing text? To answer questions like
these, it is not enough to have the necessary information. We must
organise that information in a way that allows us to find the answers in
time to satisfy our needs.</p>
<p>Representing information is fundamental to computer science. The
primary purpose of most computer programs is not to perform
calculations, but to store and retrieve information – usually as fast as
possible. For this reason, the study of data structures and the
algorithms that manipulate them is at the heart of computer science. And
that is what this book is about – helping you to understand how to
structure information to support efficient processing.</p>
<p>Any course on data structures and algorithms will try to teach you
about three things:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>It will present a collection of commonly used data structures and
algorithms. These form a programmer’s basic “toolkit”. For many
problems, some data structure or algorithm in the toolkit will provide a
good solution. We focus on data structures and algorithms that have
proven over time to be most useful.</li>
<li>It will introduce the idea of tradeoffs, and reinforce the concept
that there are costs and benefits associated with every data structure
or algorithm. This is done by describing, for each data structure, the
amount of space and time required for typical operations. For each
algorithm, we examine the time required for key input types.</li>
<li>It will teach you how to measure the effectiveness of a data
structure or algorithm. Only through such measurement can you determine
which data structure in your toolkit is most appropriate for a new
problem. The techniques presented also allow you to judge the merits of
new data structures that you or others might invent.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are often many approaches to solving a problem. How do we
choose between them? At the heart of computer program design are two
(sometimes conflicting) goals:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>To design an algorithm that is easy to understand, code, and
debug.</li>
<li>To design an algorithm that makes efficient use of the computer’s
resources.</li>
</ol>
<p>Ideally, the resulting program is true to both of these goals. We
might say that such a program is “elegant.” While the algorithms and
program code examples presented here attempt to be elegant in this
sense, it is not the purpose of this book to explicitly treat issues
related to goal (1). These are primarily concerns for the discipline of
Software Engineering. Rather, we mostly focus on issues relating to goal
(2).</p>
<p>How do we measure efficiency? Our method for evaluating the
efficiency of an algorithm or computer program is called <a
href="section-14.html#asymptotic-analysis" class="term"
title="A method for estimating the efficiency of an algorithm or computer program by identifying its asymptotic complexity, the growth rate of its complexity function. Asymptotic analysis also gives a way to define the inherent difficulty of a problem. We frequently use the term algorithm analysis to mean the same thing.">asymptotic
analysis</a>. Asymptotic analysis also gives a way to define the
inherent difficulty of a problem. Throughout the book we use asymptotic
analysis techniques to estimate the time cost for every algorithm
presented. This allows you to see how each algorithm compares to other
algorithms for solving the same problem in terms of its efficiency.</p>
