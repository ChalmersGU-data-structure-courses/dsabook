Abstract data types</h2>
<p>Earlier, we introduced the term <a href="section-14.html#data-type"
class="term"
title="A type together with a collection of operations to manipulate the type.">data
type</a>, which refers to a type along with a collection of operations
for manipulating values of that type. For instance, integers form a data
type, and addition is an operation that can be performed on them. These
are known as <em>concrete</em> data types, meaning they consist of
actual values and a specific implementation. In contrast, an <a
href="section-14.html#abstract-data-type" class="term"
title="Abbreviated ADT. The specification of a data type within some language, independent of an implementation. The interface for the ADT is defined in terms of a type and a set of operations on that type. The behaviour of each operation is determined by its inputs and outputs. An ADT does not specify *how* the data type is implemented. These implementation details are hidden from the user of the ADT and protected from outside access, a concept referred to as encapsulation.">abstract
data type</a> (ADT) does not specify concrete values or implementations.
Instead, it defines a data type purely in terms of a set of operations
and the expected behaviour of those operations, as determined by their
inputs and outputs. An ADT does not dictate <em>how</em> the operations
should be implemented, and multiple implementations are often possible.
These implementation details are hidden from the user—a concept known as
<a href="section-14.html#encapsulation" class="term"
title="In programming, the concept of hiding implementation details from the user of an ADT, and protecting data members of an object from outside access.">encapsulation</a>.
The set of operations offered by an abstract data type is known as its
<a href="section-14.html#interface" class="term"
title="An interface is a class-like structure that only contains method signatures and fields. An interface does not contain an implementation of the methods or any data members.">application
programming interface</a> (API).</p>
<p>Using an ADT, we can distinguish between the logical behaviour of a
data type and its actual implementation in a concrete program. A classic
example is the <a href="section-14.html#list" class="term"
title="A finite, ordered sequence of data items known as elements. This is close to the mathematical concept of a sequence. Note that &#39;ordered&#39; in this definition means that the list elements have position. It does not refer to the relationship between key values for the list elements (that is, &#39;ordered&#39; does not mean &#39;sorted&#39;).">list</a>
abstract data type, which support the following set of operations:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre
class="sourceCode pseudo"><code class="sourceCode pseudo"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">interface</span> <span class="bu">List</span> <span class="kw">of</span> T:</span>

<p>A list can be implemented using either an array or a linked list.
Users of a list do not need to know which implementation is used in
order to make use of its functionality. The actual implementations of an
ADT rely on specific <em>data structures</em> to realise the desired
behaviour of the operations – for example, calculating the size of a
list.</p>
<p>Although different implementations of an abstract data type offer the
same set of operations, the choice of <a
href="section-14.html#data-structure" class="term"
title="The implementation for an ADT.">data structure</a> can
significantly impact the <em>efficiency</em> of those operations. Often,
there are trade-offs involved: optimising one operation may come at the
cost of another. For example, an array-based list allows fast access to
elements at specific indices, while a linked-list implementation excels
at inserting elements at the front. Furthermore, different applications
may prioritise different operations. One program might frequently
perform operation A, while another relies more heavily on operation B.
In such cases, it is often not possible to implement all operations
efficiently, so multiple implementations of the same ADT are needed.
Additionally, one implementation may be more efficient for small
datasets (thousands of elements), whereas another may scale better for
large datasets (millions of elements). The most suitable data structure
depends on the specific use case, and making informed and well-reasoned
choices is one of the central goals of this book.</p>
<div class="online">
<section id="sec:example-collection-of-records"
class="level4 unnumbered example">
<h4 class="unnumbered">Example: Collection of records</h4>
<p>A <em>database</em> is a structured collection of data that can be
easily accessed, managed, and updated. Each item in a database is
typically called a <em>record</em>, which consists of multiple fields
containing information—such as a name, an ID number, or an address.
Efficiently organising, storing, and searching these records is a key
challenge in database design.</p>
<p>Two popular implementations for managing large disk-based database
applications are <a href="section-14.html#hashing" class="term"
title="A search method that uses a hash function to convert a search key value into a position within a hash table. In a properly implemented hash system, that position in the table will have high probability of containing the record that matches the key value. Sometimes, the hash function will return a position that does not store the desired key, due to a process called collision. In that case, the desired record is found through a process known as collision resolution.">hashing</a>
and the <a href="section-14.html#b-tree" class="term"
title="A method for indexing a large collection of records. A B-tree is a balanced tree that typically has high branching factor (commonly as much as 100 children per internal node), causing the tree to be very shallow. When stored on disk, the node size is selected to be same as the desired unit of I/O (hence some multiple of the disk sector size). This makes it easy to gain access to the record associated with a given search key stored in the tree with few disk accesses. The most commonly implemented variant of the B-tree is the B+ tree.">B-tree</a>.
Both support efficient insertion and deletion of records, as well as
exact-match queries. However, they differ in the types of queries they
handle best. Hashing is particularly efficient for exact-match queries,
where you are looking for a record with a specific key. On the other
hand, B-trees are better suited for <em>range queries</em>, where you
want to retrieve all records with keys within a certain interval. In
such cases, hashing becomes inefficient.</p>
<p>Therefore, if a database application only requires exact-match
queries, hashing is typically the better choice. But if the application
needs to support range queries—such as finding all records with values
between X and Y—the B-tree is preferred. Despite their performance
differences, both data structures address the same core problem: how to
efficiently update and search a large collection of records.</p>
</section>
</div>
<p>The concept of an ADT can help us to focus on key issues even in
non-computing applications.</p>
<section id="sec:example-cars" class="level4 unnumbered example">
<h4 class="unnumbered">Example: Cars</h4>
<p>When operating a car, the primary activities are steering,
accelerating, and braking. On nearly all passenger cars, you steer by
turning the steering wheel, accelerate by pushing the gas pedal, and
brake by pushing the brake pedal. This design for cars can be viewed as
an ADT with operations “steer”, “accelerate”, and “brake”. Two cars
might implement these operations in radically different ways, say with
different types of engine, or front- versus rear-wheel drive. Yet, most
drivers can operate many different cars because the ADT presents a
uniform method of operation that does not require the driver to
understand the specifics of any particular engine or drive design. These
differences are deliberately hidden.</p>
</section>
<p>The concept of an ADT is one instance of an important principle that
must be understood by any successful computer scientist: managing
complexity through abstraction. A central theme of computer science is
complexity and techniques for handling it. Humans deal with complexity
by assigning a label to an assembly of objects or concepts and then
manipulating the label in place of the assembly. Cognitive psychologists
call such a label a <em>metaphor</em>. A particular label might be
related to other pieces of information or other labels. This collection
can in turn be given a label, forming a hierarchy of concepts and
labels. This hierarchy of labels allows us to focus on important issues
while ignoring unnecessary details.</p>
<section id="sec:example-computers-hard-drives-and-cpus"
class="level4 unnumbered example">
<h4 class="unnumbered">Example: Computers, hard drives, and CPUs</h4>
<p>We apply the label “hard drive” to a collection of hardware that
manipulates data on a particular type of storage device, and we apply
the label “CPU” to the hardware that controls execution of computer
instructions. These and other labels are gathered together under the
label “computer”. Because even the smallest home computers today have
millions of components, some form of abstraction is necessary to
comprehend how a computer operates.</p>
</section>
<p>Consider how you might go about the process of designing a complex
computer program that implements and manipulates an ADT. The ADT is
implemented in one part of the program by a particular data structure.
While designing those parts of the program that use the ADT, you can
think in terms of operations on the data type without concern for the
data structure’s implementation. Without this ability to simplify your
thinking about a complex program, you would have no hope of
understanding or implementing it.</p>
<p>Most of the abstract data types we introduce in this book are
collections, that is, structures that store elements of an arbitrary
type. The earlier example of a list illustrates this: a list is a
collection that holds elements, which can be of any type.</p>
<p>We group these collection-based ADTs into two main categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Linear collections</li>
<li>Sets and maps</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to these, we also introduce graphs, along with their
commonly used implementations.</p>
<p>The rest of this gives a high-level overview of the ADTs covered
throughout the course. <a href="#fig:adt-overview">Figure 1.1</a>
summarises these ADTs and highlights how they relate to one another.
Each ADT will be discussed in more detail later in the book, including
their operations and the data structures used to implement them.</p>

<h3 data-number="1.7.1"><span class="header-section-number">1.7.1</span>
Linear collections</h3>
<p>Linear collections are a category of abstract data types in which the
order of the elements matters. This means that each element has a
specific position in the sequence, and operations on the ADT are
sensitive to this order. Insertion, removal, and retrieval operations
often depend on the position within the sequence.</p>
<p>The ordered sequence ADTs found in this book are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Stacks</strong>: sequences with a Last-In-First-Out
(LIFO) ordering</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Queues</strong>: sequences with a First-In-First-Out
(FIFO) ordering</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Double-ended queues</strong> (deques): allow insertion
and removal at both ends</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority queues</strong>: return elements based on
priority rather than insertion order</p></li>
<li><p><strong>General lists</strong>: support adding, removing, and
accessing elements</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Ordered sequences are used in many applications and algorithms where
the order of operations or items is important. For example, maintaining
a task list, simulating a line of customers, or a editor’s undo/redo
history.</p>
</section>
<section id="sec:adt-sets-and-maps" class="level3" data-number="1.7.2">
<h3 data-number="1.7.2"><span class="header-section-number">1.7.2</span>
Sets and maps</h3>
<p>Many programming tasks involve <em>retrieving specific
information</em> from a large dataset. For example, given a collection
of people, how do we efficiently find the person with a specific
personnummer? Two key abstract data types are commonly used to solve
such information retrieval problems:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Sets</strong>: represent unordered collections of
distinct items. They support operations to <em>add</em> and
<em>remove</em> elements, and to <em>check</em> whether a particular
element is present. Duplicate elements are not allowed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Maps</strong> (also called dictionaries): represent
collections of <em>key-value pairs</em>, where each <em>key</em> maps to
a corresponding <em>value</em>. Operations include <em>adding</em> or
<em>removing</em> key-value pairs, <em>checking</em> if a key is
present, and <em>retrieving</em> the value associated with a given key.
Like sets, maps do not allow duplicate keys.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Most implementations of both sets and maps are designed to support
fast insertion, deletion, and lookup operations, making them ideal for
managing collections where quick access to data is important.</p>
</section>
<section id="sec:adt-graphs" class="level3" data-number="1.7.3">
<h3 data-number="1.7.3"><span class="header-section-number">1.7.3</span>
Graphs</h3>
<p>Another well-known abstract data type is the <em>graph</em>. Graphs
are used to model relationships between elements, where each element is
called a <em>node</em> or <em>vertex</em>. A <em>relation</em> between
two nodes is represented by an <em>edge</em>, which may carry additional
information to describe the nature or strength of the relationship—such
as distance, cost, or capacity.</p>
<p>Graphs appear in many real-world scenarios, often in surprising ways.
A classic example is a map, where cities are represented as nodes and
roads (with distances) as edges. Graph algorithms can then be used to
solve problems such as finding the shortest route between two cities.
Another, less obvious example is the structure of Java programs: the
dependencies between Java classes can be represented as a graph. This
representation helps us determine the correct order to compile classes
based on their dependencies.</p>
<p>Graphs are a fundamental concept in computer science, and we dedicate
an entire chapter to them in this book. <a
href="section-13.html#sec:graphs">Chapter 13</a> explores how graphs can
be represented and how we can traverse and manipulate them using various
algorithms.</p>
