Selecting a Data Structure</h2>
<p>It should go without saying that people write programs to solve
problems. However, sometimes programmers forget this. So it is crucial
to keep this truism in mind when selecting a <a
href="10-glossary.html#data-structure" class="term"
title="The implementation for an ADT.">data structure</a> to solve a
particular <a href="10-glossary.html#problem" class="term"
title="A task to be performed. It is best thought of as a function or a mapping of inputs to outputs.">problem</a>.
Only by first analyzing the problem to determine the performance goals
that must be achieved can there be any hope of selecting the right data
structure for the job. Poor program designers ignore this analysis step
and apply a data structure that they are familiar with but which is
inappropriate to the problem. The result is typically a slow program.
Conversely, there is no sense in adopting a complex representation to
“improve” a program that can meet its performance goals when implemented
using a simpler design.</p>
<p>When selecting a data structure to solve a problem, you should follow
these steps.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Analyze your problem to determine the <a
href="10-glossary.html#basic-operation" class="term"
title="Examples of basic operations include inserting a data item into the data structure, deleting a data item from the data structure, and finding a specified data item.">basic
operations</a> that must be supported. Examples of basic operations
include inserting a data item into the data structure, deleting a data
item from the data structure, and finding a specified data item.</li>
<li>Quantify the resource constraints for each operation.</li>
<li>Select the data structure that best meets these requirements.</li>
</ol>
<p>This three-step approach to selecting a data structure
operationalizes a data-centered view of the design process. The first
concern is for the data and the operations to be performed on them, the
next concern is the representation of those data, and the final concern
is the implementation of that representation.</p>
<p>Resource constraints on certain key operations, such as search,
inserting data records, and deleting data records, normally drive the
data structure selection process. Many issues relating to the relative
importance of these operations are addressed by the following three
questions, which you should ask yourself whenever you must choose a data
structure.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Are all data items inserted into the data structure at the
beginning, or are insertions interspersed with other operations? Static
applications (where the data are loaded at the beginning and never
change) typically get by with simpler data structures to get an
efficient implementation, while dynamic applications often require
something more complicated.</li>
<li>Can data items be deleted? If so, this will probably make the
implementation more complicated.</li>
<li>Are all data items processed in some well-defined order, or is
searching for specific data items allowed? “Random access” search
generally requires more complex data structures.</li>
</ol>
<p>Each data structure has associated costs and benefits. In practice,
it is hardly ever true that one data structure is better than another
for use in all situations. If one data structure or algorithm is
superior to another in all respects, the inferior one will usually have
long been forgotten. For nearly every data structure and algorithm
presented in this book, you will see examples of where it is the best
choice. Some of the examples might surprise you.</p>
<p>A data structure requires a certain amount of space for each data
item it stores, a certain amount of time to perform a single basic
operation, and a certain amount of programming effort. Each problem has
constraints on available space and time. Each solution to a problem
makes use of the basic operations in some relative proportion, and the
data structure selection process must account for this. Only after a
careful analysis of your problem’s characteristics can you determine the
best data structure for the task.</p>
<section id="example-bank" class="level4 unnumbered topic">
<h4 class="unnumbered">Example: Bank</h4>
<p>A bank must support many types of transactions with its customers,
but we will examine a simple model where customers wish to open
accounts, close accounts, and add money or withdraw money from accounts.
We can consider this problem at two distinct levels: (1) the
requirements for the physical infrastructure and workflow process that
the bank uses in its interactions with its customers, and (2) the
requirements for the database system that manages the accounts.</p>
<p>The typical customer opens and closes accounts far less often than
accessing the account. Customers are willing to spend many minutes
during the process of opening or closing the account, but are typically
not willing to wait more than a brief time for individual account
transactions such as a deposit or withdrawal. These observations can be
considered as informal specifications for the time constraints on the
problem.</p>
<p>It is common practice for banks to provide two tiers of service.
Human tellers or automated teller machines (ATMs) support customer
access to account balances and updates such as deposits and withdrawals.
Special service representatives are typically provided (during
restricted hours) to handle opening and closing accounts. Teller and ATM
transactions are expected to take little time. Opening or closing an
account can take much longer (perhaps up to an hour from the customer’s
perspective).</p>
<p>From a database perspective, we see that ATM transactions do not
modify the database significantly. For simplicity, assume that if money
is added or removed, this transaction simply changes the value stored in
an account record. Adding a new account to the database is allowed to
take several minutes. Deleting an account need have no time constraint,
because from the customer’s point of view all that matters is that all
the money be returned (equivalent to a withdrawal). From the bank’s
point of view, the account record might be removed from the database
system after business hours, or at the end of the monthly account
cycle.</p>
<p>When considering the choice of data structure to use in the database
system that manages customer accounts, we see that a data structure that
has little concern for the cost of deletion, but is highly efficient for
search and moderately efficient for insertion, should meet the resource
constraints imposed by this problem. Records are accessible by unique
account number (sometimes called an <a
href="10-glossary.html#exact-match-query" class="term"
title="Records are accessed by unique identifier.">exact-match
query</a>). One data structure that meets these requirements is the <a
href="8-hashing.html#hashing" class="term"
title="A search method that uses a hash function to convert a search key value into a position within a hash table. In a properly implemented hash system, that position in the table will have high probability of containing the record that matches the key value. Sometimes, the hash function will return a position that does not store the desired key, due to a process called collision. In that case, the desired record is found through a process known as collision resolution.">hash
table</a>. Hash tables allow for extremely fast exact-match search. A
record can be modified quickly when the modification does not affect its
space requirements. Hash tables also support efficient insertion of new
records. While deletions can also be supported efficiently, too many
deletions lead to some degradation in performance for the remaining
operations. However, the hash table can be reorganized periodically to
restore the system to peak efficiency. Such reorganization can occur
offline so as not to affect ATM transactions.</p>
</section>
<section id="example-databases" class="level4 unnumbered topic">
<h4 class="unnumbered">Example: Databases</h4>
<p>A company is developing a database system containing information
about cities and towns in the United States. There are many thousands of
cities and towns, and the database program should allow users to find
information about a particular place by name (another example of an
exact-match query). Users should also be able to find all places that
match a particular value or range of values for attributes such as
location or population size. This is known as a <a
href="10-glossary.html#range-query" class="term"
title="Records are returned if their relevant key value falls within a specified range.">range
query</a>.</p>
<p>A reasonable database system must answer queries quickly enough to
satisfy the patience of a typical user. For an exact-match query, a few
seconds is satisfactory. If the database is meant to support range
queries that can return many cities that match the query specification,
the user might tolerate the entire operation to take longer, perhaps on
the order of a minute. To meet this requirement, it will be necessary to
support operations that process range queries efficiently by processing
all cities in the range as a batch, rather than as a series of
operations on individual cities.</p>
<p>The hash table suggested in the previous example is inappropriate for
implementing our city database, because it cannot perform efficient
range queries. The <a href="10-glossary.html#b-tree" class="term"
title="A method for indexing a large collection of records. A B-tree is a balanced tree that typically has high branching factor (commonly as much as 100 children per internal node), causing the tree to be very shallow. When stored on disk, the node size is selected to be same as the desired unit of I/O (hence some multiple of the disk sector size). This makes it easy to gain access to the record associated with a given search key stored in the tree with few disk accesses. The most commonly implemented variant of the B-tree is the B+ tree.">B-tree</a>
supports large databases, insertion and deletion of data records, and
range queries. However, a simple <a href="10-glossary.html#linear-index"
class="term"
title="A form of indexing that stores key-value pairs in a sorted array. Typically this is used for an index to a large collection of records stored on disk, where the linear index itself might be on disk or in main memory. It allows for efficient search (including for range queries), but it is not good for inserting and deleting entries in the array. Therefore, it is an ideal indexing structure for when the system needs to do range queries but the collection of records never changes once the linear index has been created.">linear
index</a> would be more appropriate if the database is created once, and
then never changed, such as an atlas distributed on a CD or accessed
from a website.</p>
