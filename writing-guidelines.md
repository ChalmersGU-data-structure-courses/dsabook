# Guidelines when writing the book

- British or American spelling?

- Headings are *not* capitalised

- Abbreviations/acronyms: written out the first time they're mentioned (BST, ADT, etc.)

- Style: Prefer "we/us" form (instead of impersonal "one")

- Try to write one sentence per line (use soft wrap in you editor)
    - then git diffs become easier to read

## VSCode settings

Check the following settings in VSCode
- Insert final newline
- Trim trailing whitespace
