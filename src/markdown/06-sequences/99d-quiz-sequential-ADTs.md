### Summary questions {-}

Here are some general practice questions about various data structures in this chapter.


:::::::::: question ::::::::::
The term "LIFO" is associated with which
data structure?

- [x] Stack
- [ ] List
- [ ] Queue
- [ ] All of these
- [ ] None of these

::: hints
- LIFO means "Last-in, First-out".
:::
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::



:::::::::: question ::::::::::
Which of the following is not a linear data
structure?

- [x] These are all linear data structures
- [ ] Queue
- [ ] Array-based list
- [ ] Linked list
- [ ] Stack

::: hints
- We studied all of these data structures in this chapter.
:::
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::



:::::::::: question ::::::::::
Which data structure would be used to
implement recursion?

- [x] Stack
- [ ] Queue
- [ ] Array-based list
- [ ] Linked list
- [ ] Tree

::: hints
- When unwinding from recursion, we say that you "pop" the recursive "stack".
:::
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::



:::::::::: question ::::::::::
Which data structure allows insertion only
at the top, and deletion only at the top?

- [x] Stack
- [ ] Queue
- [ ] Array-based list
- [ ] Linked list
- [ ] Tree

::: hints
- We use the term "top" with only one of these data structures.
- We add and remove at the "top" with the stack.
:::
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::



:::::::::: question ::::::::::
Which data structure allows insertion only
at the back, and removing only from the front?

- [x] Queue
- [ ] Stack
- [ ] Array-based list
- [ ] Linked list
- [ ] Tree

::: hints
- We did not cover trees in this chapter.
- Lists do not restrict where inserts and removes take place.
:::
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::



:::::::::: question ::::::::::
The terms "enqueue" and "dequeue" are
associated with which data structure?

- [x] Queue
- [ ] Stack
- [ ] Array
- [ ] List
- [ ] All of these
- [ ] None of these

::: hints
- What does "enqueue" and "dequeue" mean?
:::
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::



:::::::::: question ::::::::::
The terms "add/insert" and "delete" are
traditionally associated with which data structure(s)?

- [x] List
- [ ] Stack
- [ ] Queue
- [ ] All of these
- [ ] None of these

::: hints
- Stacks and Queues have special terminology that is used
instead of the more general "insert" and "delete".
:::
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::



:::::::::: question ::::::::::
The term "FIFO" is associated with which
data structure?

- [x] Queue
- [ ] List
- [ ] Stack
- [ ] Freelist
- [ ] All of these
- [ ] None of these

::: hints
- FIFO means "first-in, first-out"
:::
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::



:::::::::: question ::::::::::
Which of the following is not a linear data
structure?

- [x] Tree
- [ ] Queue
- [ ] Array-based list
- [ ] Linked list
- [ ] Stack
- [ ] These are all linear data structures

::: hints
- Which is the one data structure not covered in this chapter?
:::
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::



:::::::::: question ::::::::::
The terms "push" and "pop" are associated
with which data structure?

- [x] Stack
- [ ] Queue
- [ ] Array
- [ ] List
- [ ] All of these
- [ ] None of these

::: hints
- "Push" and "pop" are special terminology associated with
one of these data structures.
- You push items onto a stack, and pull them off.
