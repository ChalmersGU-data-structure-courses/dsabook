## Specialised algorithms on weighted graphs {#specialised-graph-algorithms}

In this section we present two specialised algorithms on weighted directed graphs:

Floyd's algorithm
: This algorithm finds the shortest paths between *all pairs of vertices* in a graph.

Topological sort
: This algorithm sorts the vertices of a *directed acyclic graph* (DAG), so that no edges point "backwards".
  This is crucial to solve various scheduling problems.
