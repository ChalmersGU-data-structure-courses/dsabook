# Algorithm analysis, part 2: Theory {#algorithm-analysis-theory}

In chapter [-@sec:algorithm-analysis-introduction] we introduced the ideas behind algorithmic analysis, and explained the basics on an abstract level.
Now that you understand everything about sorting algorithms, we can go into more depth with our analysis tools.

After reading this chapter you should be able to analyse the computational complexity of most algorithms, both for sorting and the data structures we will introduce later.
