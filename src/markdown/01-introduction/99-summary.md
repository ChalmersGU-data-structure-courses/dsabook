## Chapter summary

This chapter introduced the role of data structures and algorithms in computer science and software development.
Through simple examples, we demonstrated how choosing the right data structure or algorithm can (greatly) enhance the performance and efficiency of programs.
We covered important concepts such as _abstract data types_ and provided an overview of the main categories of data structures discussed in the book: ordered sequences, trees, sets, maps, and graphs.

We also introduced _algorithm analysis_ and explained how asymptotic notation helps us compare the efficiency of different approaches.
To support all readers, the chapter included a brief review of essential mathematical tools and basic programming concepts needed to understand and implement algorithms effectively.

In the following chapter, we delve deeper into the formal analysis of algorithms, focusing on systematic methods to compare time and space complexity across various solutions.
