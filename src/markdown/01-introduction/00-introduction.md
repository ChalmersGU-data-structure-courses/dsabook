# Introduction {#introduction}

***Extend this introduction just a little***

This book assumes that you are already familiar with mathematics and programming, corresponding to a semester of university studies.
The online appendices present what we assume that you already know about mathematical and programming.
They serve as a review and reference, allowing you to revisit relevant sections in later chapters.
