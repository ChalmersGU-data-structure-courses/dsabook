<!--
## Special-purpose sorting algorithms

::: TODO
- Prio 3: write this section
    - It's not possible to make a generic sorting algorithm better than n log n, but if the data is restricted we can
    - non-comparative sorting
:::

### Distribution sorting

::: TODO
- counting sort: keys are finite range of integers
- bucket sort: hashable keys (refer to hashing chapter)
- binsort (referred in chapter 7)
:::

### Sorting strings (or other kinds of sequences)

::: TODO
- Radix sort: sorting strings or numbers as digit sequences (or bit sequences)
- Multi-key quicksort (aka three-way radix quicksort)
- Example: Suffix arrays
