### Review questions: Binary tree definition

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: quiz ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::: question ::::::::::
Which statement is false?

- [x] Every binary tree has at least one node
- [ ] Every non-empty binary tree has exactly one root node
- [ ] Every node in a binary tree has exactly two children
- [ ] Every non-root node in a binary tree has exactly one parent

::: hints
- Look carefully at the definition for a binary tree.
- It states that every binary tree is either empty, or it has
a root node and two binary trees as children.
- So, every binary tree node has two children, but not every
binary tree has a node.

:::::::::: question ::::::::::
What is the minimum number of nodes in a
complete binary tree with height 3?

<input type="text" value="8"/>

::: hints
- Start filling in the tree level by level.
- Stop when you draw the first node at level 3.

:::::::::: question ::::::::::
Select the one true statement.

- [x] None of the alternatives
- [ ] Every binary tree is either complete or full
- [ ] Every complete binary tree is also a full binary tree
- [ ] Every full binary tree is also a complete binary tree
- [ ] No binary tree is both complete and full

::: hints
- Not every binary tree is either complete or full.
- Not every complete binary tree is full.
- Not every full binary tree is complete.
- Some complete trees are full.

:::::::::: question ::::::::::
What is the minimum number of nodes in a
full binary tree with height 3?

<input type="text" value="7"/>

::: hints
- First, draw a vertical chain of 4 nodes. This is a tree with height 3.
- Next, add nodes to make the tree be full.

:::::::::: question ::::::::::
Suppose T is a binary tree with 14 nodes.
What is the minimum possible height of T?

<input type="text" value="3"/>

::: hints
- Try drawing this as a complete treee.
- That is, build a tree of 14 nodes by filling it in level by level.

:::::::::: question ::::::::::
What is the minimum number of internal nodes
in a binary tree with 8 nodes?

<input type="text" value="4"/>

::: hints
- Try drawing some trees. Your best bet is to try and make it full.
