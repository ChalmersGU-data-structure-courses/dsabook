:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: quiz ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::: question ::::::::::
Answer TRUE or FALSE.

There is only one way that a given problem can be solved.

- [ ] True
- [x] False

::: hints
- There are always an infinite number of ways to solve a
problem (though there might be only one "reasonable" approach).
:::
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::



:::::::::: question ::::::::::
Answer TRUE or FALSE.

There are some algorithms that do not terminate for certain inputs.

- [ ] True
- [x] False

::: hints
- By the technical definition of "algorithm", all algorithms terminate.
- Of course, that means that some programs are not technically algorithms.
:::
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::



:::::::::: question ::::::::::
Answer TRUE or FALSE.

An algorithm is a series of steps that act as a recipe to solve a particular problem.

- [x] True
- [ ] False

::: hints
- This is as good a descriptive definition for "algorithm" as any.
:::
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::



:::::::::: question ::::::::::
Answer TRUE or FALSE.

A problem instance is a series of steps that act as a recipe to solve a particular problem.

- [ ] True
- [x] False

::: hints
- A problem instance is a particular input for a problem.
:::
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::



:::::::::: question ::::::::::
Answer TRUE or FALSE.

A problem is an instantiation of an algorithm implemented in a specific programming language.


- [ ] True
- [x] False

::: hints
- A PROGRAM is an instantiation of an algorithm implemented in a specific programming language.
:::
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::



:::::::::: question ::::::::::
Answer TRUE or FALSE.

A program is an instantiation of an algorithm implemented in a specific programming language.


- [x] True
- [ ] False

::: hints
- This statement captures the relationship between a program and an algorithm.
:::
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::



:::::::::: question ::::::::::
Answer TRUE or FALSE.

An algorithm can only work if it is written in the right type of programming language.


- [ ] True
- [x] False

::: hints
- All programming languages implement the same set of
algorithms. Though, some languages make certain algorithms
easier to implement than do other languages.
:::
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::



:::::::::: question ::::::::::
Answer TRUE or FALSE.

A problem maps inputs to outputs.

- [x] True
- [ ] False

::: hints
- This is the standard technical definition for a problem.
:::
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::



:::::::::: question ::::::::::
Answer TRUE or FALSE.

An algorithm maps inputs to outputs.

- [ ] True
- [x] False

::: hints
- No. A PROBLEM maps inputs to outputs.
- An algorithm implements the mapping.
:::
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::



:::::::::: question ::::::::::
Answer TRUE or FALSE.

A program maps inputs to outputs.

- [ ] True
- [x] False

::: hints
- No. A PROBLEM maps inputs to outputs.
- A program implements an algorithm.
:::
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::



:::::::::: question ::::::::::
Answer TRUE or FALSE.

A problem instance is a specific selection of values for the problem input.

- [x] True
- [ ] False

::: hints
- This is correct.
:::
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::



:::::::::: question ::::::::::
Which is the best definition for algorithm?

- [x] A recipe
- [ ] A program
- [ ] A mapping from input to output

::: hints
- An algorithm is implemented using a program, but it is not a program.
- A problem is a mapping from input to output.
- While informal, the term "recipe" captures the essence of what an algorithm is.
:::
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::



:::::::::: question ::::::::::
Which is true about the relationship between algorithms and problems?

- [x] A problem is a mapping from inputs to
outputs, and there might be many algorithms that can accomplish this mapping.
- [ ] A problem is a mapping from inputs to outputs.
Since this mapping is fixed, there is only one right way to compute the mapping.
- [ ] An algorithm is another term for a problem.
- [ ] A problem is a recipe, and an algorithm is a solution to a problem.

::: hints
- A problem is a mapping from inputs to outputs.
- An algorithm is a recipe.
- There are many algorithms that can solve a given problem.
