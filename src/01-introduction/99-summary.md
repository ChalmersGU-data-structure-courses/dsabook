:::::::::: question ::::::::::
A tool for measuring the efficiency of an algorithm or problem is:

- [x] Algorithm analysis
- [ ] The system clock
- [ ] A profiler
- [ ] Empirical analysis

::: hints
- A profiler works on a program, not an algorithm.
- The system clock works on a program, not an algorithm.
- Empirical analysis works on a program, not an algorithm.
- Algorithm analysis estimates the cost of an algorithm or problem.

:::::::::: question ::::::::::
Which of these is NOT a definition for efficiency in a computer program?

- [x] It runs in linear time
- [ ] It solves the problem within the required resource contraints
- [ ] It requires fewer resources than known alternatives

::: hints
- One definition for an efficient program is that it runs within the required resource constraints.
- One definition for an efficient program is that it requires fewer resources than known alternatives.
- Many efficient programs require more than linear time. Sometimes linear time is not efficient for a given problem.

:::::::::: question ::::::::::
An exact-match query is:

- [x] A query where a record is returned if its unique identifier matches the search value.
- [ ] A query where a record is returned if its relevant key value falls within a specified range.
- [ ] Another name for any database query that returns a key value.
- [ ] A way of efficiently locating the records in a database.

::: hints
- Returning a record that falls within a range is called a range query.
- There are many database queries that are not exact-match queries.
- Whether a search is efficient or not has nothing to do with whether it is an exact-match query or not.
- A query to find the record that matches a unique identifier is called an exact-match query.

:::::::::: question ::::::::::
Which is NOT a topic that a this course book focuses on?

- [x] How to design and maintain large programs.
- [ ] The commonly used data structures.
- [ ] Introduce the idea of tradeoffs and reinforce the concept that there are costs and benefits associated with every data structure.
- [ ] How to measure the effectiveness of a data structure or algorithm.

::: hints
- A key topic for any DSA course is the basic toolkit of data structures and algorithms.
- A key concept for any DSA course is the concept of tradeoffs for costs versus benefits.
- A key skill for any DSA course is ability to measure the effectiveness of a data structure or algorithm.
- Designing and maintaining large programs is a focus for Software Engineering.

:::::::::: question ::::::::::
As computers have become more powerful:

- [x] We have used that additional computing power to tackle more complex problems.
- [ ] The need for good algorithms has become less because processor speed can make up for a slow algorithm.
- [ ] The algorithms have become easier to understand.
- [ ] We are better able to use our everyday intuition to solve problems.

::: hints
- Good solutions for large, complex computational problems usually require different approaches than what we do in everyday life.
- As problems that we try to solve grow more complicated, their solutions tend to grow more complicated.
- Processor speed cannot grow as fast as the cost of a slower algorithm applied to a bigger problem.
- As our computers have become more powerful, our history has been to apply them to more complex problems.

:::::::::: question ::::::::::
A range query is:

- [x] A query where a record is returned if its relevant key value falls between a pair of values.
- [ ] A query where a record is returned if its unique identifier matches the search value.
- [ ] Another name for any database query for a key value.
- [ ] A way of efficiently locating the records in a database.

::: hints
- A query to find the record that matches a unique identifier is called an exact-match query.
- There are many database queries that are not range queries.
-  Whether a search is efficient or not has nothing to do with whether it is a range query or not.
- Returning a record that falls within a range is called a range query.

:::::::::: question ::::::::::
Which of these is more a concern for Software Engineering than for a data structures course?

- [x] To design an algorithm that is easy to understand, code, and debug.
- [ ] To design an algorithm that makes efficient use of the computer's resources.

::: hints
- Designing efficient programs is a focus for data structures and algorithms courses.
- Designing and maintaining large programs is a focus for Software Engineering.

:::::::::: question ::::::::::
Which of these is NOT one of the three standard steps to follow when selecting a data structure to solve a problem?

- [x] Run simulations to quantify the expected running time of the program.
- [ ] Analyze your problem to determine the basic operations that must be supported.
- [ ] Quantify the resource constraints for each operation.
- [ ] Select the data structure that best meets the requirements determined in the prior steps of the process.

::: hints
- Knowing the basic operations required to solve your problem is the first step to selecting a suitable data structure.
- Knowing the resource constraints for your problem's basic operations is the second step to selecting a suitable data structure.
- Once you know the basic operations and their resource constraints, then you can select a data structure that matches.
- Many problems do not require that you run simulations to determine the expected times for alternative solutions.
