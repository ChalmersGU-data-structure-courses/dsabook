## Primitive data types

::: TODO
- We will only use these: boolean, integer, float, character
- We assume characters are fixed-size unicode - but sometimes 8-bit ascii
- Sometimes we might talk about fixed-size integers (32-bit, 64-bit)
- Python-specific details: no fixed-size ints, chars == strings
