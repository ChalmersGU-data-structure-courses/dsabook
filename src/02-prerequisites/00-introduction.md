# Prerequisites: Programming, mathematics

::: TODO
- Very quick run-down of what programming and math concepts we we use in the book
- Note that we use pseudocode in this book
- Note that Python doesn't use many of the basic types we need
- Don't need lots of explanations - we can refer to other places instead
