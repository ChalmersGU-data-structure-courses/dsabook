### Complexity analysis

::: TODO
- complexity
- cutoff to insertion sort *does not* change complexity
- stable, not in-place
:::

### Bottom-up mergesort

::: TODO
- using lists of lists
- arrays: using run-lengths of 1, 2, 4, 8, ...
:::

### Run-based mergesort

::: TODO
- "natural" mergesort in Wikipedia
- find already sorted runs, store run-starts in array
- merge adjacent runs
- Optimisation: decide which runs to merge
- Optimisation: bitonic (alternating ascending and descending runs)
- Example: Timsort
