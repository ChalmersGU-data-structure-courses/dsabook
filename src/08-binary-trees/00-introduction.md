[Tree]{.term} structures enable efficient
access and efficient update to large collections of data.
[Binary trees](#binary-tree){.term} in
particular are widely used and relatively easy to implement. But binary
trees are useful for many things besides searching. Just a few examples
of applications that trees can speed up include
[prioritizing jobs](#priority-queues),
[describing mathematical expressions](#binary-tree-node-implementations)
and the syntactic elements of computer programs, or
organizing the information needed to drive
[data compression algorithms](#huffman-coding-trees).

This chapter covers terminology used for discussing binary trees,
[tree traversals](#binary-tree-traversals),
approaches to implementing tree [nodes](#binary-tree-node-implementations), 
and various examples of binary trees.
