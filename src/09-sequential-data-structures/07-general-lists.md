## Implementing general lists using dynamic arrays or linked lists

::: TODO
- Recall list API
- Dyn arrays can do most things efficient (except insert/remove from the middle)
- (Doubly) linked lists can only modify from front/rear
- But with a pointer it's efficient to modify in the mdidle (see Java Spliterator)
