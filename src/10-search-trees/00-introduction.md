This chapter covers *balanced binary search trees (BSTs)*, a data
structure that uses a binary tree to implement a set or a map. Balanced
BSTs are the first data structure we see that implements the set and map
operations efficiently. In a balanced BST, insertion, deletion and
lookup all take $O(\log n)$ time.
